Patients who underwent radial keratotomy several years ago, are currently reporting to the ophthalmologist due to worsening of vision associated with age-related cataracts. In this case report we present a case of a 60-year-old woman who underwent radial keratotomy with 16 incisions in the right eye and 12 incisions in the left eye. The patient reported to an ophthalmologist due to a deterioration of vision caused by a cataract. We described, in detail, the difficulties encountered during the diagnostic procedures, differences in the calculation of intraocular lens, and intraoperative difficulties as compared to patients who had not undergone radial keratotomy. We also present the obtained postoperative results.;;;;;10.3390/medicina58050689;2022-05-29;[{'lastname': 'Dołowiec-Kwapisz', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Hospital in Zgorzelec, 59-900 Zgorzelec, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Misiuk-Hojło', 'firstname': 'Marta', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Wrocław Medical University, 50-556 Wrocław, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Piotrowska', 'firstname': 'Halina', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Hospital in Zgorzelec, 59-900 Zgorzelec, Poland.'}]

3;35538104;Development of a standardized in vitro model to reproduce hydrophilic acrylic intraocular lens calcification.;[];Scientific reports;Opacification through calcification of hydrophilic acrylic intraocular lenses (IOL) is a severe complication after cataract surgery. Causing symptoms that range from glare through to severe vision loss, the only effective therapy is explantation of the opacified IOL so far. Although IOL calcification is a well-described phenomenon, its pathogenesis is not fully understood yet. The purpose of the current study was to develop a laboratory model to replicate IOL calcification. Calcification could be reproduced using a horizontal electrophoresis and aqueous solutions of calcium chloride and disodium hydrogen phosphate. The analysis of the in vitro calcified IOLs was performed using light microscopy, Alizarin Red and Von Kossa staining, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and electron crystallography using transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction. The presented laboratory model could be used to identify hydrophilic IOLs that are at risk to develop calcification and to assess the influence of associated risk factors. In addition, it can serve as a research tool to further understand this pathology.;;;;© 2022.

4;35513494;Intraoperative aberrometry compared to preoperative Barrett True-K formula for intraocular lens power selection in eyes with prior refractive surgery.;[];Scientific reports;To compare the predictive refractive accuracy of intraoperative aberrometry (ORA) to the preoperative Barrett True-K formula in the calculation of intraocular lens (IOL) power in eyes with prior refractive surgery undergoing cataract surgery at the Loma Linda University Eye Institute, Loma Linda, California, USA. We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients with a history of post-myopic or hyperopic LASIK/PRK who underwent uncomplicated cataract surgery between October 2016 and March 2020. Pre-operative measurements were performed utilizing the Barrett True-K formula. Intraoperative aberrometry (ORA) was used for aphakic refraction and IOL power calculation during surgery. Predictive refractive accuracy of the two methods was compared based on the difference between achieved and intended target spherical equivalent. A total of 97 eyes (69 patients) were included in the study. Of these, 81 eyes (83.5%) had previous myopic LASIK/PRK and 16 eyes (16.5%) had previous hyperopic LASIK/PRK. Median (MedAE)/mean (MAE) absolute prediction errors for preoperative as compared to intraoperative methods were 0.49 D/0.58 D compared to 0.42 D/0.51 D, respectively (P = 0.001/0.002). Over all, ORA led to a statistically significant lower median and mean absolute error compared to the Barrett True-K formula in post-refractive eyes. Percentage of eyes within ± 1.00 D of intended target refraction as predicted by the preoperative versus the intraoperative method was 82.3% and 89.6%, respectively (P = 0.04). Although ORA led to a statistically significant lower median absolute error compared to the Barrett True-K formula, the two methods are clinically comparable in predictive refractive accuracy in patients with prior refractive surgery.;;;;© 2022.

7;35502115;Endoilluminator-aided cataract surgery in eyes with corneal opacity - A modified surgical approach.;['cataract', 'corneal opacity', 'endoilluminator', 'penetrating keratoplasty', 'retroillumination'];Indian journal of ophthalmology;"Cataract and corneal blindness continue to be leading causes of reversible blindness in India. These can co-exist in a multitude of pathologies such as trauma, healed keratitis (old herpetic scar), chronic degenerative changes such as labrador keratopathy, bullous keratopathy, corneal dystrophies etc. Phacoemulsification in such eyes is rewarding to the patient in terms of minimal intervention, less risk of complications owing to reduced open sky time (as in case of combined keratoplasty), and better predictable visual outcomes. Approach to such eyes with poor visualisation is highly challenging.
We illustrate a modified surgical technique of chandelier illumination through pars plana for cataract surgery in eyes with corneal opacity of varying grades.
Five patients with dense cataract and small pupils, associated with corneal opacity (leucomatous and macular grade) are described. Closed chamber phacoemulsification with intraocular lens with or without pupil expanders was performed assisted by 23 or 25 gauge pars plana chandelier illumination introduced in the vitreous cavity through a sclerotomy wound made prior to phacoemulsification in the inferotemporal quadrant.
Chandelier illumination aids in reducing the light scatter that occurs due to corneal opacity. Ease of visualisation of lens structures and of performing cataract surgery was noticed. One case was combined with penetrating keratoplasty with reduced open sky time. This assisted technique has advantages such as enhancing visualisation intraoperatively and allowing working in closed chamber. Its self-retaining nature aids bimanual manipulation. No complications were encountered. The video highlights the utility, advantages and practicality of chandelier retroillumination in patients with corneal opacities of varying degree undergoing phacoemulsification.

8;35502038;Histopathological analysis of residual lens cells in capsular opacities after cataract surgery using objective software.;['Capsular opacification', 'immunohistochemistry', 'intraocular lens', 'objective software', 'post-mortem eyes'];Indian journal of ophthalmology;"Remnant lens epithelial cells (LECs) within the capsular bag (CB) undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and acquire a myofibroblast phenotype, depositing extracellular matrix (ECM) components, leading to posterior capsular opacification (PCO). This study histopathologically analyzes the LEC-to-myofibroblast transition and de novo ECM component deposition (i.e., smooth muscle actin (SMA) and fibronectin (FN) expression) and determines the intraocular lens (IOL) and patient factors associated with these changes.
In total, 190 CBs with IOLs were removed from donor eyes. Digital images were obtained, and PCO was graded using published software (ADOS, Medical Parachute). Automated immunohistochemistry was performed using anti-SMA to detect EMT and anti-FN to document ECM remodeling. Slides were digitized and analyzed using the Positive Pixel Count v9 algorithm. Linear regression and Poisson regression were performed (P < 0.05).
SMA positive expression decreased as the time of IOL implantation increased (P < 0.0001). Positivity of SMA and FN demonstrated a positive correlation (P = 0.0002). Controlling for confounding factors in Poisson regression, hydrophobic and hydrophilic materials showed higher FN and SMA expression when compared to silicone material lenses (FN; P = 0.018; P < 0.0001, SMA; P = 0.001; P = 0.003, respectively). The square optic design had 29% higher SMA positivity compared to the opti-edge design (P = 0.042). One-piece haptic lenses had higher SMA expression compared to three-piece haptic (P = 0.042). A higher risk of expression of SMA and FN was seen in patients with a history of smoking, hypertension, and glaucoma (P < 0.05).
This study demonstrated that SMA and FN expression is different according to IOL design and patient factors, thus indicating that LEC changes depend on lens biocompatibility. Therefore, by analyzing the histopathological composition of PCO by using LECs, further insight into the characteristics of IOLs that are important for biocompatibility can be ascertained.";;;;;10.4103/ijo.IJO_291_21;2022-05-04;[{'lastname': 'Mastromonaco', 'firstname': 'Christina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology and Ophthalmology, The MUHC-McGill University Ocular Pathology Laboratory, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Balazsi', 'firstname': 'Matthew', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Medical Parachute, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Coblentz', 'firstname': 'Jacqueline', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology and Ophthalmology, The MUHC-McGill University Ocular Pathology Laboratory, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Dias', 'firstname': 'Ana Beatriz Toledo', 'initials': 'ABT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology and Ophthalmology, The MUHC-McGill University Ocular Pathology Laboratory, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Zoroquiain', 'firstname': 'Pablo', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology and Ophthalmology, The MUHC-McGill University Ocular Pathology Laboratory, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Burnier', 'firstname': 'Miguel N', 'initials': 'MN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology and Ophthalmology, The MUHC-McGill University Ocular Pathology Laboratory, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.'}]

The management of RRD may be challenging in cases of aphakic patients with Marfan.
To report on the management of four cases of simultaneous RRD and aphakia with vitrectomy, silicone oil tamponade, and retropupillary iris-claw intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in patients with Marfan that have been operated at the Jules-Gonin Eye Hospital between 2019 and 2020.
Ages at presentation were 20, 30, 32, and 31 years, respectively. All patients had a history of extraction of a dislocated lens. None of the patients had a previous posterior vitrectomy. Two patients had records of previous measurements for IOL calculation by optical biometry (IOL Master, Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena, Germany) about 1 year prior to the RRD development. In two cases, measurements for IOL calculation by optical biometry were based on the contralateral eye.
All patients underwent 23 G vitrectomy, peripheral iridotomy, and retropupillary iris-claw IOL. No intraoperative complications were encountered. All patients had silicone oil tamponade, one of which required heavy silicone oil. Silicone oil was removed 3 months following primary surgery. Minimum follow-up was 1 year. The single surgery anatomic success rate was 100%. All patients had visual acuity of at least 0.8 at the last follow-up (1.25, 1.0, 0.8, and 0.8 respectively). The targeted refractive results were accurately achieved in all four cases postoperatively. One patient presented ocular hypertension 2 weeks after surgery due to presumed steroid response and was managed conservatively. None of the patients had silicone oil migration into the anterior chamber.
Retropupillary iris-claw IOL implantation in cases of RRD and aphakia creates a barrier to tamponades from the posterior segment, effectively preventing them from entering the anterior segment of the eye. Therefore, the management of aphakia and retinal detachment with simultaneous vitrectomy and a retropupillary iris-claw IOL may be a successful strategy in reducing postoperative complications in patients with Marfan syndrome.

Die Behandlung der rhegmatogenen Netzhautablösung kann bei aphaken Patienten mit Marfan-Syndrom eine Herausforderung darstellen.
Bericht über 4 Patienten mit Marfan-Syndrom und gleichzeitiger rhegmatogener Netzhautablösung und Aphakie, die mittels Vitrektomie, Silikonöltamponade und Implantation einer retropupillären Artisan-Linse zwischen 2019 und 2020 am Hôpital ophtalmique Jules-Gonin operiert wurden.
Das Alter bei der Vorstellung lag bei 20, 30, 32 sowie 31 Jahren. Alle Patienten hatten eine vorausgehende Extraktion einer dislozierten Linse in der Vergangenheit. Keiner der Patienten hatte eine vorherige Pars-plana-Vitrektomie. Bei 2 Patienten lagen die Daten einer Biometrie (IOL Master, Zeiss) vor, die etwa 1 Jahr vor der Entwicklung der rhegmatogenen Netzhautablösung gemessen wurden. In 2 Fällen basierten die Messungen für die IOL-Berechnung mittels optischer Biometrie auf dem kontralateralen Auge.
Alle Patienten wurden mittels einer 23-G-Vitrektomie, einer peripheren Iridotomie sowie einer retropupillären Iris-Klauen-Intraokularlinse behandelt. Es traten keine intraoperativen Komplikationen auf. Bei allen Patienten wurde eine Silikonöltamponade durchgeführt, bei einem Patienten war die Verwendung von schwerem Silikonöl erforderlich. Das Silikonöl wurde 3 Monate nach dem Primäreingriff entfernt. Die Nachbeobachtungszeit betrug mindestens 12 Monate. Die anatomische Erfolgsrate mit einem einzigen Eingriff betrug 100%. Alle Patienten hatten bei der letzten Nachuntersuchung eine Sehschärfe von mindestens 0,8. (1,25; 1,0; 0,8 und 0,8). Die angestrebten refraktiven Ergebnisse wurden in allen 4 Fällen postoperativ genau erreicht. Die Artisan-Linse blieb postoperativ klar. Ein Patient wies 2 Wochen nach der Operation aufgrund einer vermuteten Steroidreaktion eine okuläre Hypertension auf und wurde konservativ behandelt. Bei keinem der Patienten kam es zu einer Migration von Silikonöl in die Vorderkammer.
Die gleichzeitige Behandlung der Aphakie und der Netzhautablösung bei Marfan-Patienten mittels einer retropupillären Iris-Klauen-Intraokularlinse ist nicht mit wichtigen operativen Komplikationen verbunden, da die Artisan-IOL zusätzlich zur Aphakiebehandlung auch als Barriere gegen das Eindringen der Silikonöltamponade in die Vorderkammer agiert.";Retropupillary iris-claw IOL implantation in cases of RRD and aphakia creates a barrier to tamponades from the posterior segment, effectively preventing them from entering the anterior segment of the eye.

10;35472791;Two Surgical Approaches for Intraocular Lens Dislocation: Pars Plana Vitrectomy Versus Core Vitrectomy with Lens Exchange.;[];Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde;"To compare the efficacy and safety of core vitrectomy and pars plana vitrectomy for lens exchange in patients with intraocular lens dislocation.
This is a retrospective study conducted at one eye center in Zurich, Switzerland. We reviewed 124 eyes with dislocated intraocular lens undergoing lens exchange carried out by two surgeons between 03/2016 and 12/2019 (45 months). Intraocular pressure (IOP) and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were analyzed preoperatively and at 5 time points up to 12 months after lens exchange. Data on postoperative complications were collected.
There were 124 eyes with intraocular lens dislocation that were referred for lens exchange. Of these eyes, 59 (48%) received core vitrectomy and 65 (52%) received pars plana vitrectomy with lens exchange. Glaucoma was more frequent in the core vitrectomy group (78%) than in the pars plana vitrectomy group (32%; p < 0.001). In the core vitrectomy group, 19 (32%) eyes presented with visual impairment, 17 (29%) eyes presented with high IOP alone, and 23 (39%) eyes presented with both at the same time prior to surgery. Mean preoperative IOP in the core vitrectomy group decreased from 22.4 ± 9.2 mmHg to 14.7 ± 3.1 mmHg 12 months after surgery (p < 0.001). Mean BCVA changed from 0.40 ± 0.41 logMAR preoperatively to 0.32 ± 0.37 logMAR at 12 months postoperatively (p = 0.598) in the core vitrectomy group. In the pars plana vitrectomy group, 44 (68%) eyes presented with a change in vision, 7 (11%) eyes presented with high IOP alone, and 14 (22%) eyes presented with pressure elevation and visual impairment at the visit prior to surgery. Mean preoperative IOP in the pars plana vitrectomy group decreased from 20.9 ± 8.3 mmHg to 15.1 ± 3.5 mmHg at 12 months after lens exchange (p < 0.001). Mean BCVA in the pars plana vitrectomy group was 0.57 ± 0.62 logMAR preoperatively and 0.22 ± 0.35 logMAR 12 months postoperatively (p < 0.001). Postoperative pressure decompensation occurred more frequently in the core vitrectomy group (20%) than in the pars plana vitrectomy group (6%; p = 0.018).

Diese Studie vergleicht die Pars-plana-Vitrektomie und die Core-Vitrektomie in Kombination mit einem Linsenwechsel zur chirurgischen Behandlung der subluxierten Intraokularlinse.
Dies ist eine retrospektive Studie, die an einem Augenzentrum in Zürich durchgeführt wurde. Es wurden 124 Augen mit Linsensubluxation untersucht, die im Zeitraum zwischen 03/2016 und 12/2019 (45 Monate) einem Linsenwechsel unterzogen wurden. Intraokulardruck (IOD) und bestkorrigierter Fernvisus wurden präoperativ und zu 5 unterschiedlichen Zeitpunkten bis 12 Monate nach dem Linsenwechsel erhoben. Daten zu postoperativen Komplikationen wurden analysiert.
124 Augen mit Subluxation der Intraokularlinse wurden zum Linsenwechsel zugewiesen. Bei 59 (48%) Augen wurde eine Core-Vitrektomie und bei 65 (52%) Augen wurde eine Pars-plana-Vitrektomie in Kombination mit dem Linsenwechsel durchgeführt. In der Core-Vitrektomie-Gruppe (78%) waren mehr Augen von einem Glaukom betroffen als in der Pars-plana-Vitrektomie-Gruppe (32%; p < 0,001). In der Core-Vitrektomie-Gruppe wurde vor dem Linsenwechsel bei 19 (32%) Augen eine Visusminderung, bei 17 (29%) Augen ein Intraokulardruckanstieg und bei 23 (39%) Augen beide Symptome festgestellt. Der durchschnittliche Intraokulardruck sank in der Core-Vitrektomie-Gruppe von 22,4 ± 9,2 mmHg präoperativ auf 14,7 ± 3,1 mmHg 12 Monate postoperativ (p < 0,001). Der durchschnittliche bestkorrigierte Fernvisus stieg in der Core-Vitrektomie-Gruppe von 0,40 ± 0,41 logMAR vor der Operation auf 0,32 ± 0,37 logMAR 12 Monate postoperativ (p = 0,598). In der Pars-plana-Vitrektomie-Gruppe wurde vor der Operation bei 44 (68%) Augen eine Visusminderung, bei 7 (11%) Augen ein Intraokulardruckanstieg und bei 14 (22%) Augen beide Symptome festgestellt. Der durchschnittliche bestkorrigierte Fernvisus stieg in der Pars-plana-Vitrektomie-Gruppe von 0,57 ± 0,62 logMAR präoperativ auf 0,22 ± 0,35 logMAR 12 Monate postoperativ (p < 0,001). Postoperative Druckdekompensationen waren häufiger in der Core-Vitrektomie-Gruppe (20%) als in der Pars-plana-Vitrektomie-Gruppe (6%; p = 0,018).

11;35467755;Immediate sequential bilateral surgery versus delayed sequential bilateral surgery for cataracts.;[];The Cochrane database of systematic reviews;"Age-related cataract affects both eyes in most cases. Most people undergo cataract surgery in both eyes on separate days, referred to as delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery (DSBCS). An alternative procedure involves operating on both eyes on the same day, but as two separate procedures, known as immediate sequential bilateral cataract surgery (ISBCS). Potential advantages of ISBCS include fewer hospital visits for the patient, faster visual recovery, and lower healthcare costs. Nevertheless, concerns exist about possible bilateral, postoperative, sight-threatening adverse effects with ISBCS. Therefore, there is a clear need for evaluating evidence regarding the safety, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of ISBCS versus DSBCS.
To assess the safety of ISBCS compared to DSBCS in people with bilateral age-related cataracts and to summarise current evidence for the incremental resource use, utilities, costs, and cost-effectiveness associated with the use of ISBCS compared to DSBCS in people with bilateral age-related cataracts (primary objectives). The secondary objective was to assess visual and patient-reported outcomes of ISBCS compared to DSBCS in people with bilateral age-related cataracts.
We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2021, Issue 5); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov; the WHO ICTRP; and DARE and NHS EED on the CRD Database on 11 May 2021. There were no language restrictions. We limited the searches to a date range of 2007 onwards.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to assess complications, refractive outcomes, best-corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) with ISBCS compared to DSBCS. We included non-randomised (NRSs), prospective, and retrospective cohort studies comparing ISBCS and DSBCS for safety assessment, because of the rare incidence of important adverse events. To assess cost-effectiveness of ISBCS compared to DSBCS, we included both full and partial economic evaluations, and both trial-based and model-based economic evaluations.
We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures and assessed risk of bias for NRSs using the ROBINS-I tool. For cost-evaluations, we used the CHEC-list, the CHEERS-checklist, and the NICE-checklist to investigate risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence with the GRADE tool. We reported results for economic evaluations narratively.
We included 14 studies in the review; two RCTs, seven NRSs, and six economic evaluations (one study was both an NRS and economic evaluation). The studies reported on 276,260 participants (7384 for ISBCS and 268,876 for DSBCS) and were conducted in Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Iran, (South) Korea, Spain (Canary Islands), Sweden, the UK, and the USA. Overall, we considered the included RCTs to be at 'high to some concerns' risk of bias for complications, 'some concerns' risk of bias for refractive outcomes and visual acuity, and 'high' risk of bias for PROMs. The overall risk of bias for NRSs was graded 'serious' regarding complications and 'serious to critical' regarding refractive outcomes.  With regard to endophthalmitis, we found that relative effects were estimated imprecisely and with low certainty, so that relative estimates were not reliable. Nonetheless, we found a very low risk of endophthalmitis in both ISBCS (1/14,076 participants) and DSBCS (55/556,246 participants) groups. Based on descriptive evidence and partially weak statistical evidence we found no evidence of an increased risk of endophthalmitis with ISBCS. Regarding refractive outcomes, we found moderate-certainty (RCTs) and low-certainty (NRSs) evidence there was no difference in the percentage of eyes that did not achieve refraction within 1.0 dioptre of target one to three months after surgery (RCTs: risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 1.26; NRSs: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.75). Similarly, postoperative complications did not differ between groups (RCTs: RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.52 to 3.40; NRSs: 1.04, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.29), although the certainty of this evidence was very low for both RCTs and NRSs. Furthermore, we found low-certainty (RCTs) to very low-certainty (NRSs) evidence that total costs per participant were lower for ISBCS compared to DSBCS, although results of individual studies could not be pooled. Only one study reported on cost-effectiveness. This study found that ISBCS is cost-effective compared to DSBCS, but did not measure quality-adjusted life years using preferred methods and calculated costs erroneously. Finally, regarding secondary outcomes, we found limited evidence on BCDVA (data of two RCTs could not be pooled, although both studies individually found no difference between groups (very low-certainty evidence)). Regarding PROMs, we found moderate-certainty evidence (RCTs only) that there was no difference between groups one to three months after surgery (standardised mean difference -0.08, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.03).
Current evidence supports there are probably no clinically important differences in outcomes between ISBCS and DSBCS, but with lower costs for ISBCS. However, the amount of evidence is limited, and the certainty of the evidence was graded moderate to very low. In addition, there is a need for well-designed cost-effectiveness studies.";;;;Copyright © 2022 The Cochrane Collaboration.

However, posterior capsular opacification (PCO) has become the most common and challenging complication in cataracts surgery. While various approaches such as surface modification and drug prophylaxis have been investigated to prevent PCO development, there is no standard treatment that is sufficiently safe and effective to meet clinical demands. Near-infrared (NIR) light-triggered photothermal therapy is an attractive noninvasive treatment for PCO prophylaxis. We fabricated a new type of IOL with excellent biocompatibility, stability, and photothermal conversion property. Polyethyleneimine (PEI) and graphene oxide (GO) were layer-by-layer assembled on model polymethylmethacrylate and IOL substrates, and the thickness, surface roughness, and wettability of the substrates with different numbers of bilayers were evaluated. After the reduction of GO to reduced GO (rGO), a rGO/PEI multilayer thin film with good stability and photothermal conversion capability was obtained. The rGO/PEI multilayer coating was able to induce apoptosis in lens epithelium cells under 808-nm NIR laser irradiation in vitro. Finally, rGO@IOL was implanted into rabbit eyes, and the biocompatibility and ability to prevent PCO were evaluated for 5 weeks. The rGO@IOL implant exhibited excellent PCO prevention ability with the assistance of NIR irradiation and did not induce obvious pathological effects in surrounding healthy tissues. The rGO@IOL implant with good biocompatibility, good physicochemical stability, and excellent photothermal conversion property shows promise for clinical application in PCO prophylaxis.;;;;Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Patients that appear to be aphakic centrally may still present with angle closure secondary to residual peripheral lens material. This case highlights the importance of keeping this etiology on the differential in a patient with presumed aphakia.";;;;© 2022.

19;35366842;Comparison of preoperative angle kappa measurements in the eyes of cataract patients obtained from Pentacam Scheimpflug system, optical low-coherence reflectometry, and ray-tracing aberrometry.;['Angle kappa', 'Cataract', 'Lenstar', 'Pentacam', 'iTrace'];BMC ophthalmology;"Angle kappa plays a vital role in the implantation of multifocal intraocular lens (MIOL). Large angle kappa is related to a higher risk of postoperative photic phenomena. This study aims to compare preoperative angle kappa in the eyes of cataract patients obtained from the Pentacam Scheimpflug system (Pentacam), optical low-coherence reflectometry (Lenstar), and ray-tracing aberrometry (iTrace).
One hundred thirteen eyes of 113 patients with cataracts were included. Each eye was examined 3 times using all devices to obtain angle kappa and pupil diameter. When considering dependent eyes for one individual, angle kappa in both right eyes and left eyes should be analysed separately. The repeatability and reproducibility were evaluated using the within-subject standard deviation (Sw), repeatability (2.77 Sw), and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The difference, correlation, and agreement between devices were evaluated by paired t-tests, Pearson tests, and Bland-Altman analysis, respectively.
Intraoperator repeatability and interoperator and intersession reproducibility of angle kappa showed an Sw of less than 0.05 mm, a 2.77 Sw of 0.14 mm or less, and an ICC of more than 0.96. Angle kappa was not significantly different between Pentacam and Lenstar (P > 0.05), while angle kappa was significantly different between Pentacam and iTrace and between Lenstar and iTrace (P < 0.05). There was a strong correlation between Pentacam and Lenstar for angle kappa (r =0.907 to 0.918) and a weak or moderate correlation between Pentacam and iTrace and between Lenstar and iTrace (r =0.292 to 0.618). There were narrow 95% limits of agreement (LoA) between Pentacam and Lenstar for angle kappa and wide 95% LoA between Pentacam and iTrace and between Lenstar and iTrace. No significant differences in pupil diameter were found between Pentacam and Lenstar in either eye (P > 0.05). Positive angle kappa (nasal light reflex) was found in most cataract patients (79.25% to 84.91%) through 3 different devices in both eyes.
The 3 devices provided high intraoperator repeatability and interoperator and intersession reproducibility for angle kappa measurements.

Prospective observational study evaluating infants with cataract undergoing surgery.
We analysed 173 eyes of 97 infants (76 bilateral); median age 18.7 weeks, (IQR: 11-33.9 weeks). Toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus and herpes infection was the most common aetiology in both unilateral 10 (47.6%) and bilateral 43 (55.1%) cases, followed by familial and syndromic cases. Fifty-four eyes (29.5%) received primary intraocular lens (IOL) implantation.Seventy-five infants (76%) were less than 6 months of age. At 1-year follow-up, mean log MAR best-corrected visual acuity was 1.00±0.08 and 1.21±0.03 in unilateral and bilateral cases respectively (p=0.012), which was not statistically significant. At 1-year follow-up, pseudophakic(1.09±0.05) eyes had a better mean log MAR visual acuity comparing aphakes(1.24±0.04) clinically but was not statistically significant after the application of Bonferroni correction (p=0.012). The mean myopic shift of -2.9 D±0.39 and -4.53 D±0.55 over 1 year was noted in aphakes and pseudophakes, respectively (p=0.016).

Some cardiovascular and respiratory conditions make the patients breathless when they lie down, whereas other neurological and spinal problem patients are also equally uncomfortable. The only reasonable solution to conduct surgery on a patient who cannot lie down flat on the operating table is to position them face to face in a sitting position.

Corneal astigmatism (CA) was measured using AL-Scan at 2.4- and 3.3-mm diameter zones and calculated using the Barrett toric calculator preoperatively and postoperatively. The mean absolute error and centroid prediction error for the two zones were computed using double-angle plots. In total, 101 eyes of 76 patients were analyzed. Mean patient age was 68.7 ± 9.3 years and mean preoperative CA power was 0.7 ± 0.5 D.

As an introduction, some aspects of terminology, epidemiology, lens anatomy and pathophysiology of age-related cataract, selected for clinical interest and relevance, are outlined. Clinical aspects include signs and symptoms: Objective criteria for cortical, nuclear and posterior subcapsular cataract are described, followed by typical symptoms such as decreased visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and foggy vision, altered colour perception, decreased mesopic and scotopic vision, glare, myopization and monocular diplopia. Diagnostic evaluation consists of a general ophthalmic examination, including history, refraction and vision testing, tonometry and morphologic examination of anterior and posterior segment, and is supplemented by special tests and examinations, such as interference vision (retinometer), keratometry including corneal topo-/tomography, biometry (ultrasound and optical), specular microscopy of the corneal endothelium and OCT of the central retina. Treatment is exclusively surgical: Evaluating the indication for surgery individually, weighing chances and risks, determining individual decisions such as anesthesia, surgical technical options, target refraction and intraocular lens options is discussed in detail. Finally, some perioperative considerations for medical treatment and infection prophylaxis are outlined.

We conducted our study to re-evaluate the role of (LRI) in correcting pre-existing moderate corneal astigmatism during cataract surgery in settings where other options are neither available nor affordable.
Retrospective analysis of all consecutive cases of LRI performed by a single surgeon at the time of cataract surgery to correct moderate corneal astigmatism (1.5-3D) in a community hospital over a period of 6 months. Corneal astigmatism, uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) and best corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) were recorded pre-operatively, 4 weeks and 3 months post-operatively. Data on age, intraocular lens (IOL) power, predictive refraction and post-operative spherical equivalent was also collected and analyzed. The number and position of LRI was determined based on the pre-existing corneal astigmatism using online calculator.

To assess visual acuity (VA), incidence of complications and additional eye operations, and refractive error outcomes 5 years after pediatric lensectomy among children younger than 13 years.
This prospective cohort study used data from the Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group clinical research registry. From June 2012 to July 2015, 61 eye care practices in the US, Canada, and the UK enrolled children from birth to less than 13 years of age who had undergone lensectomy for any reason during the preceding 45 days. Data were collected from medical record reviews annually thereafter for 5 years until September 28, 2020.
Lensectomy with or without implantation of an intraocular lens (IOL).
Best-corrected VA and refractive error were measured from 4 to 6 years after the initial lensectomy. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the 5-year incidence of glaucoma or glaucoma suspect and additional eye operations. Factors were evaluated separately for unilateral and bilateral aphakia and pseudophakia.
A total of 994 children (1268 eyes) undergoing bilateral or unilateral lensectomy were included (504 [51%] male; median age, 3.6 years; range, 2 weeks to 12.9 years). Five years after the initial lensectomy, the median VA among 701 eyes with available VA data (55%) was 20/63 (range, 20/40 to 20/100) in 182 of 316 bilateral aphakic eyes (58%), 20/32 (range, 20/25 to 20/50) in 209 of 386 bilateral pseudophakic eyes (54%), 20/200 (range, 20/50 to 20/618) in 124 of 202 unilateral aphakic eyes (61%), and 20/65 (range, 20/32 to 20/230) in 186 of 364 unilateral pseudophakic eyes (51%). The 5-year cumulative incidence of glaucoma or glaucoma suspect was 46% (95% CI, 28%-59%) in participants with bilateral aphakia, 7% (95% CI, 1%-12%) in those with bilateral pseudophakia, 25% (95% CI, 15%-34%) in those with unilateral aphakia, and 17% (95% CI, 5%-28%) in those with unilateral pseudophakia. The most common additional eye surgery was clearing the visual axis, with a 5-year cumulative incidence of 13% (95% CI, 8%-17%) in participants with bilateral aphakia, 33% (95% CI, 26%-39%) in those with bilateral pseudophakia, 11% (95% CI, 6%-15%) in those with unilateral aphakia, and 34% (95% CI, 28%-39%) in those with unilateral pseudophakia. The median 5-year change in spherical equivalent refractive error was -8.38 D (IQR, -11.38 D to -2.75 D) among 89 bilateral aphakic eyes, -1.63 D (IQR, -3.13 D to -0.25 D) among 130 bilateral pseudophakic eyes, -10.75 D (IQR, -20.50 D to -4.50 D) among 43 unilateral aphakic eyes, and -1.94 D (IQR, -3.25 D to -0.69 D) among 112 unilateral pseudophakic eyes.
In this cohort study, development of glaucoma or glaucoma suspect was common in children 5 years after lensectomy.

37;35119034;Opacification of refractive bifocal intraocular lens in one month: Three case reports.;[];Medicine;"Multifocal intraocular lenses (IOLs) are used widely. However, the discovery of LS-313 MF15/30 (Oculentis B.V.) opacity during surgery has not yet been reported. This article reports 3 cases of LS-313 MF15/30 (Oculentis B.V.) IOL opacity found during cataract surgery implantation within 1 month.
Three patients underwent cataract surgery, and opacification of their IOL (LS-313 MF15/30, Oculentis B.V.) was found intraoperatively.
The patient was diagnosed with a postoperative intraocular opacity.
In case 1, the surgeon scrubbed the IOL with intraocular perfusion fluid and a gelatin sponge swab to reduce opacity in the central optical area of the IOL and then implanted it into the capsule bag. In case 2, the surgeon used the infusion-aspiration polishing mode for cleaning. To avoid IOL wear and bag damage, washing was stopped when turbidity in the center of the optical area was reduced. In case 3, we learned from our previous experience that the surgeon cut the IOL into 2 pieces and moved it out at the main incision, which was replaced and implanted with a brand new IOL, after the implanted IOL was again found cloudy.
In case 1, more than 10 months after the surgery, the IOL was restored to transparency, no obvious eye discomfort was noted, and uncorrected visual acuity was 20/25. In case 2, the patient's IOL surrounding area was still partially turbid after more than 10 months of follow-up. In case 3, the patient's uncorrected visual acuity on postoperative day 1 was 20/20, and the best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20.

41;35086293;Technique of using Cionni capsular tension ring in the management of of ectopia lentis cases.;['Cionni CTR', 'Ectopia lentis', 'Modified CTR', 'Subluxated lens', 'in-the-bag IOL'];Indian journal of ophthalmology;"Ectopia lentis is a condition that compromises vision in childhood by inducing either double vision or aphakic visual axis. Correction of lens status is of prime importance to prevent amblyopia or sensory strabismus.
Placing an intraocular lens (IOL) in the bag in such cases will maintain aqueous vitreous barrier but it is a difficult task.This video demonstrates the method of placing modified Cionni capsular tension ring (CTR) and placement of IOL in children.
This video shows the management of multiple cases of ectopia lentis with more than 180 degree subluxation. Making intact rhexis is crucial and technically difficult in such cases. The way of making a proper capsulorhexis is shown. After making capsulorhexis, all the cases were managed with single loop Cionni CTR. Cionni CTR has a loop with a anterior offset of 0.4 mm to override the anterior capsule. It has two designs - right and left design, based on the position of islet in the CTR. Since the offset of the hook is tiny, there are high chances to flip the Cionni CTR. If the Cionni CTR is placed in a flipped manner, it would not give effective pull of the bag, when fixated to sclera. And also, it could be traumatic to explant and place in correct manner. Hence it is vital to place the Cionni CTR in correct orientation, so that anterior offset will orient anteriorly. This video gives guidance to the viewers about the correct way of placing different designs of Cionni CTR in different types of subluxation.Timing of passing sutures through sclera may be done either before or after placing the Cionni CTR in the bag. Both the ways are demonstrated in different cases.
Different technique of doing Cionni CTR fixation with IOL placement are demonstrated. Surgeons who wish to try this procedure can choose the option that they feel comfortable with. We conclude that choice of Cionni CTR design and technique of placement depends on surgeon's choice and not based on the type of subluxation.

Our cross-sectional study included sixteen healthy older individuals without ocular diseases (controls; 55-80 years; 63.6 ± 5.6y; 8 women) and 13 patients with previous cataract and bilateral IOL (eight with blue-blocking [BB] lens and five with ultraviolet-only [UV] blocking lens; 55-80 years; 69.9 ± 5.2y; 9 women). The study comprised three weeks of at home rest-activity assessments using wrist-worn actigraphs, and each week preceded a laboratory protocol.

The new toric IOL with anchor-wing haptics (NS60YT, NIDEK Co., Ltd.) was implanted in eligible patients with age-related cataracts with preoperative corneal astigmatism of 1.0 D or greater at a university hospital and two private hospitals in Japan. The following IOL cylinder powers were evaluated: 1.50 D (NS60YT3), 2.25 D (NS60YT4), 3.00 D (NS60YT5) and 4.50 D (NS60YT7). All patients were assessed out to 12 months postoperatively. The primary endpoint was visual acuity (VA) with spherical addition at 6 months postoperatively, and the primary analysis calculated the proportion of eyes with VA with spherical addition of 0.1 logMAR or better. The magnitude of rotation was compared to the intended axis of IOL implantation at each postoperative examination. Adverse events were evaluated for the safety analysis.
This study enrolled 64 eyes of 53 patients. At 6 months postoperatively, for all IOL powers, VA with spherical addition of 0.1 logMAR or better was achieved in 90% [95% confidence interval (CI): 80-96] of eyes. The mean IOL rotation was 5.3 ± 4.3° at 12 months postoperatively. The mean magnitude of rotation ranged from 1.9° to 2.5° between each postoperative examination from 1 day to 12 months. There were no vision-threatening intraoperative or postoperative complications for the duration of the study.

53;34991518;Stabilization of refractive error and associated factors following small incision phacoemulsification cataract surgery.;[];BMC ophthalmology;"Accumulating evidence suggests that refractive stabilization occurs rapidly following small incision cataract surgery. Nonetheless, many guidelines still suggest waiting four to 6 weeks before prescribing corrective lenses. This study was undertaken to supplement the existing literature regarding refractive stabilization, and evaluate multiple contributing factors that could dissuade clinicians from confidently correcting refractive error in the early post-operative course following routine cataract surgeries.
Adult patients undergoing phacoemulsification cataract surgery with uncomplicated surgeries and post-surgical courses at the Calgary Ophthalmology Centre (Calgary, Alberta, Canada) were included in this prospective observational case series. Exclusion criteria included known corneal dystrophies, infectious keratitis, complicated surgery or toric/multifocal IOLs. Data was collected at weekly intervals for a total of 6 weeks. Collected data included autorefraction, visual acuity, corneal pachymetry, and effective lens position.
One hundred six eyes of 104 patients were included in this study. Post-operative sphere, cylinder and spherical equivalent were not significantly different at any post-operative week compared with week six, and 80-86% of patients were within 0.5D of last follow-up spherical equivalent at any week. The secondary outcomes of central corneal thickness, effective lens position and visual acuity did, however, exhibit significant differences between early post-operative weeks and last follow-up values.
These data suggest that refractive error can be effectively measured and corrected as early as one-week post-operatively in the majority of patients, though other measures of post-operative stability including central corneal thickness, effective lens position and visual acuity can require up to 4 weeks to stabilize. Thus a conservative and pragmatic approach may be to wait until 4 weeks post-operatively prior to obtaining refractive correction following uncomplicated phacoemulsification cataract surgery.";;;One hundred six eyes of 104 patients were included in this study.

Seventy-eight eyes with age-related cataract undergoing phacoemulsification and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation were retrospectively enrolled. Participants were evaluated with Pentacam for ACD topography before and approximately four weeks after the surgery. The absolute changes of ACD (AACD) and the relative changes of ACD (RACD) topography were calculated, and three-dimensional topographic contours were plotted. The influence of age, gender, distance to corneal apex (DCA), temporal-nasal and superior-inferior on AACD and RACD was analyzed.
Both AACD and RACD were negatively correlated with the DCA (p < 0.001; p < 0.001) and positively correlated with the age at all DCA (p < 0.05 for all the analyses). Significantly greater AACD and RACD were observed in female subjects (p < 0.05, respectively, at all DCA). AACD was significantly larger in the temporal compared with the nasal region (p < 0.001) and at the superior compared with the inferior region (p < 0.001), but not RACD. Subgroup analysis indicated that the significant difference of the AACD between the temporal and nasal regions was manifested at the DCA of more than 6 mm (p < 0.001), and the difference between the superior and inferior regions was observed at 2 mm DCA for both AACD (p < 0.001) and RACD (p = 0.001).

Five thousand eyes from 5,000 patients who underwent cataract surgery were recruited to this study. We explored the linear relationship between B/F ratio and 13 variables using Principal Component-Multivariate Linear Regression Analysis.
The B/F ratio was negatively correlated with the difference between simulated keratometry (SimK) and true net power (TNP), central corneal thickness, spherical aberration (SA), and posterior corneal astigmatism and positively correlated with posterior corneal radius, corneal posterior surface, axial length (AL) and anterior corneal radius. Several variables (central corneal thickness, difference between SimK and TNP and asphericity coefficient (Q-value) of the posterior corneal surface) had the highest loading on the final score. B/F ratio reflects the refractive state and anatomical structure of the cornea: thus, higher B/F ratios were associated with larger posterior corneal surface curvature radius, longer axial length, thinner central corneal thickness, lower high order aberrations of the cornea and SA, and the numerical difference between simK and TNP gradually reduced.

Uneventful phacoemulsification with IOL implantation was achieved in all eyes without intraoperative complications. Slit illumination reduced the light scattering and reflection from the corneal opacity, enhanced the red reflex, and improved depth perception simultaneously in different steps of phacoemulsification. Phacoemulsification was safely performed in eyes with corneal opacity under slit illumination of the surgical microscope.

70;34891109;Physics-aware learning and domain-specific loss design in ophthalmology.;['Domain prior incorporation', 'IOL calculation', 'Physics-based learning'];Medical image analysis;The human cataract, a developing opacification of the human eye lens, currently constitutes the world's most frequent cause for blindness. As a result, cataract surgery has become the most frequently performed ophthalmic surgery in the world. By removing the human lens and replacing it with an artificial intraocular lens (IOL), the optical system of the eye is restored. In order to receive a good refractive result, the IOL specifications, especially the refractive power, have to be determined precisely prior to surgery. In the last years, there has been a body of work to perform this prediction by using biometric information extracted from OCT imaging data, recently also by machine learning (ML) methods. Approaches so far consider only biometric information or physical modelling, but provide no effective combination, while often also neglecting IOL geometry. Additionally, ML on small data sets without sufficient domain coverage can be challenging. To solve these issues, we propose OpticNet, a novel optical refraction network based on an unsupervised, domain-specific loss function that explicitly incorporates physical information into the network. By providing a precise and differentiable light propagation eye model, physical gradients following the eye optics are backpropagated into the network. We further propose a new transfer learning procedure, which allows the unsupervised pre-training on the optical model and fine-tuning of the network on small amounts of surgical patient data. We show that our method outperforms the current state of the art on five OCT-image based data sets, provides better domain coverage within its predictions, and achieves better physical consistency.;;;;Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

We enrolled 53 patients (77 eyes) with congenital lens subluxation caused by ectopia lentis, Marfan syndrome, and Weill-Marchesani syndrome who underwent primary implantation of a SF-PC-IOL. All patients underwent a complete ophthalmic examination include visual acuity (VA), intraocular pressure (IOP), intraocular lenses (IOL) position, intraoperative complications and postoperative complications. Cox regression analysis and survival analysis were used to evaluate the risk factors for postoperative complications.
Seventy seven eyes from 53 patients were included. Mean age at surgery was 23 ± 20 years (5 to 67 years), with a mean follow-up of 39 ± 27 months (12 to 130 months). The best-corrected VA improved from 0.84 ± 0.55 to 0.26 ± 0.43 logarithms of the minimum angle of resolution (p < 0.001). Best-corrected VA improved postoperatively in 73 eyes (94%). The main causes of reduced vision after surgery were retinal pathologies and amblyopia. Complications included transient intraocular haemorrhage (2 eyes, 2.6%), early vitreous incarceration (2 eyes, 2.6%), retinal detachment (6 eyes, 7.8%) and IOL dislocation (3 eyes, 3.9%).

Perspective.
Discussion includes possible factors and mechanisms associated with hydrophilic IOLs' susceptibility to calcification and posterior capsule opacification (PCO) formation.
Results of recently reported studies show that particular surgeries, such as pars plana vitrectomy, Descemet stripping (automated) endothelial keratoplasty, and Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty with intraocular gas or air injection, might predispose the calcification process of hydrophilic IOLs, leading to a significant decrease in visual quality and possibly explantation of the IOL. Hydrophilic IOLs are more susceptible than hydrophobic IOLs to PCO formation, which is the most common of late postoperative complications that are associated with significant side effects.
We believe that all patients should be informed about the higher risk of calcification and PCO associated with hydrophilic IOLs. We also recommend limiting the use of hydrophilic acrylic IOLs during cataract surgery, especially when it is combined with pars plana vitrectomy or endothelial keratoplasty, and in patients with endothelial diseases who will probably require operation on it in the future.";;;Results of recently reported studies show that particular surgeries, such as pars plana vitrectomy, Descemet stripping (automated) endothelial keratoplasty, and Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty with intraocular gas or air injection, might predispose the calcification process of hydrophilic IOLs, leading to a significant decrease in visual quality and possibly explantation of the IOL.

81;34800717;Centrifugally concentric ring-patterned drug-loaded polymeric coating as an intraocular lens surface modification for efficient prevention of posterior capsular opacification.;['Concentric ring pattern', 'Intraocular lens', 'Posterior capsular opacification', 'Spin coating', 'Surface modification'];Acta biomaterialia;Posterior capsular opacification (PCO) is the main postoperative complication after intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in cataract surgery, because of the proliferation of the residual lens epithelial cells (LECs) in the lens capsule. Drug-eluting IOLs, aimed to develop an in situ drug delivery device, are the promising concept in recent years. As IOLs are optical devices other than implants, the feasibility and applicability remain a challenge for drug-eluting coatings. In this investigation, a centrifugally concentric ring-patterned drug-loaded poly(lactide-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) coating was designed and fabricated by the spin coating technique. The concentric ring-patterned morphologies and the drug loading and release properties were carefully investigated, and the spin coating parameters were optimized. A concentric annular coating with a thin center and thick periphery was obtained, which was particularly suitable for the surface modification of IOLs, as the visual pathway of the intraocular light transmission greatly requires good light transmittance of the IOLs. IOLs with the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CsA)-loaded coating (CsA @ PLGA) modification were then fabricated for PCO prevention. The in vitro LECs culture results showed that the CsA @ PLGA coating-modified IOLs significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell death. Western blot analysis showed that the efficient cell inhibition behavior of CsA was due to the autophagy-mediated cell death pathway. The in vivo intraocular implantation results confirmed the desired PCO inhibition effect. Thus, the centrifugally concentric ring-patterned drug-loaded PLGA coating obtained by the spin coating technique provides a simple yet effective alternative of IOL modification for PCO prevention. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: • Concentric ring-patterned polymer coating, specifically for drug-eluting IOL fabrication, was developed by the spin coating technique. • The immunosuppressant CsA inhibited LEC proliferation through the autophagy-mediated cell death pathway. • Concentric ring-patterned CsA-eluting IOLs exhibited reliable in vivo PCO prevention. • The drug-eluting IOLs fabricated by the simple and economical spin coating technique have a great potential in clinical translation.;;;;Copyright © 2021.

The optimization potential of the method through a rational choice of the laser pattern and the strategy, taking into account the mechanical properties of the posterior capsule and the anatomical features of the retrolental region, is shown.
The article provides a literature review with own clinical observations and a geometric representation.
The efficiency of a laser pattern is examined with a constant capsulotomy length: The largest opening can be reached with the U‑pattern, which is followed by the +, T, H, V, O and spiral patterns in decreasing order. When estimating the size of the opening, its incircle is of particular functional importance. If the ability of the posterior capsule to tear spontaneously, which is predetermined by its anatomical and mechanical properties, is taken into account when choosing the application pattern and the laser strategy, the efficiency of the method increases.
An efficient technique is not only determined by an adapted defocusing and a minimum possible individual pulse energy setting but also characterized by the lowest possible total energy consumption if the necessary opening size is achieved by the smallest number of pulses. Taking into account the individual retrolental anatomical conditions and the mechanical properties of the NS membrane can contribute to the gentle implementation of a YAG capsulotomy.
HINTERGRUND: Die hintere Neodym-Yttrium-Aluminium-Granat-Laser-Kapsulotomie gilt als eine etablierte, einfache und komplikationsarme Methode für die Behandlung der Cataracta secundaria. Übrigens steigt die Häufigkeit der Komplikationen wie Schädigung der HKL-Optik und der vorderen Glaskörpergrenzmembran, zystoides Makulaödem, Netzhautablösung und Augendruckanstieg mit hoher Pulszahl, Einzelpuls- und Gesamtlaserenergie.
Es wird das Optimierungspotenzial des Verfahrens durch eine rationale Wahl des Applikationsmusters und der Laserstrategie unter Berücksichtigung der mechanischen Eigenschaften der hinteren Kapsel und der anatomischen Besonderheiten der retrolentalen Region gezeigt.
Der Beitrag bietet eine Literaturübersicht mit eigenen klinischen Beobachtungen und einer geometrischen Darstellung.
Der Nutzeffekt eines Applikationsmusters wird bei einer konstanten Länge des YAG-Laser-Schnittes untersucht: Die größte Lücke wird beim U‑Muster erreicht, dem die +‑, T‑, H‑, V‑, O‑ und Spiralmuster abnehmend folgen. Bei der Abschätzung der Lückengröße ist ihr Inkreis von besonderer funktioneller Bedeutung. Wird die durch die anatomischen und mechanischen Eigenschaften vorbestimmte Fähigkeit der NS-Membran zum spontanen Einreißen bei der Wahl des Applikationsmusters und der Laserstrategie berücksichtigt, steigert sich die Effizienz der Methode.
Eine effiziente Technik ist nicht nur durch ein angepasstes Defokussieren und eine minimal mögliche Einzelpulsenergieeinstellung bestimmt, sondern auch durch einen möglichst geringen Gesamtenergieverbrauch gekennzeichnet, wenn die nötige Lückengröße durch die kleinste Impulszahl erreicht wird.

Our studies suggest that the first three days after surgery are critical to their long-term outcomes. Using a rat model of lens regeneration, we evidenced lens epithelial cell (LEC) proliferation increased some 50 fold in the first day before rapidly declining to rates observed in the germinative zone of the contra-lateral, un-operated lens. Cell multi-layering at the lens equator occurred on days 1 and 2, but then reorganised into two discrete layers by day 3. E- and N-cadherin expression preceded cell polarity being re-established during the first week. Aquaporin 0 (AQP0) was first detected in the elongated cells at the lens equator at day 7. Cells at the capsulotomy site, however, behaved very differently expressing the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers fibronectin and alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA) from day 3 onwards. The physical interaction between the apical surfaces of the anterior and posterior LECs from day 3 after surgery preceded cell elongation. In the human BIL sample fibre cell formation was confirmed by both histological and proteome analyses, but the cellular response is less ordered and variable culminating in Soemmerring's ring (SR) formation and sometimes Elschnig's pearls. This we evidence for lenses from a single patient. No bow region or recognisable epithelial-fibre cell interface (EFI) was evident and consequently the fibre cells were disorganised. We conclude that lens cells require spatial and cellular cues to initiate, sustain and produce an optically functional tissue in addition to capsule integrity and the EFI.;;;;Copyright © 2021.

Each included patient underwent a second series of examinations: biometry using the IOLMaster 700 (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG) and topography using the OPD-Scan II (Nidek), 1 minute after artificial tears instillation (artificial tears group; hyaluronate de sodium 0.15%, threalose 3% [Théalose; Théa]). Changes in anterior corneal astigmatism and subsequent changes in toric IOL calculation were analyzed. The error in predicted residual astigmatism was calculated.
Anterior corneal astigmatism and total corneal astigmatism measured with the IOLMaster 700 were significantly modified when artificial tears were instilled before the examinations (1.51 ± 0.57 diopters [D], range: 0.75 to -3.55 vs 1.42 ± 0.63 D, range: 0.42 to 3.35 D;

In this technique, if there are still cortical remnants and lens epithelial cells left after the routine irrigation-aspiration and polishing at the final steps of cataract surgery, the capsule is filled to about one-third with a highly viscous cohesive ophthalmic viscosurgical device. Rinsing is performed from the anterior chamber with the water jet directed tangentially to the ophthalmic viscosurgical device bolus and towards the posterior capsule, which creates a turbulence creating a ""grindstone effect"". The ophthalmic viscosurgical device bolus transforms into a ball and starts to rotate very quickly within the capsule, grinding away the cortical remnants.
In the first series of 62 cases, there were no intra-operative or post-operative complications. At day 1 there was no corneal oedema and no hypertension of intraocular pressure. Visual outcomes were good with a mean best corrected distance visual acuity of -0.01 ± 0.11 logMAR.
This technique appears to be effective and fast in removing persistent cortical remnants from the surface of the posterior capsule, while minimising risks such as capsule aspiration during irrigation/aspiration. There is limited pressure and mechanical force applied on the capsule; the anterior chamber and the corneal endothelium remain safe since the ophthalmic viscosurgical device stays inside the capsular bag to its high cohesiveness and molecular weight. More data on a larger cohort of patients is planned to confirm these results and evaluate long-term effects on posterior capsule opacification.";"This technique appears to be effective and fast in removing persistent cortical remnants from the surface of the posterior capsule, while minimising risks such as capsule aspiration during irrigation/aspiration.

89;34743088;Cataract surgery and intraocular lens placement in patients with Fuchs corneal dystrophy: a review of the current literature.;[];Current opinion in ophthalmology;"Late-onset Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is seen in approximately 4% of individuals over the age of 40. With the growing population of adults over the age of 65, ophthalmologists need to be aware of the preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative considerations involved in cataract surgery in Fuchs patients.
Management of cataract patients with FECD requires preoperative assessment of endothelial cell size, density, and morphology. Considerations for perioperative endothelial cell loss include patients with hyperopia and shallow anterior chambers, phacoemulsification technique, transfer of ultrasonic energy to the cornea, corneal-protective perioperative agents, as well as thermal and mechanical damage.
Ophthalmologists performing cataract surgery on patients with FECD must carefully consider the risks of endothelial cell loss during surgery and minimize the risk of corneal decompensation after surgery. Preoperative management should evaluate the severity of the FECD as well as individual factors such as cataract density, the health and thickness of the cornea, and the anterior chamber depth. Perioperative techniques, adjustments to biometry calculations, and intraocular lens (IOL) selection may help optimize visual outcomes and recovery time.";;;;Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

To develop a technique for femtosecond laser-assisted phacoemulsification of hypermature cataract in patients with degree I-II lens subluxation.
Phacoemulsification of hypermature cataract with comorbid lens subluxation was performed in 78 patients (78 eyes) divided into two groups. In the 1st group (45 eyes), capsulorhexis was performed using a femtosecond laser. Patients of the 2nd group (33 eyes) underwent manual capsulorhexis. The study assessed the possible frequency of using modern methods of capsular bag fixation and complete all-in-the-bag intraocular lens (IOL) implantation, as well as the number of various types of intraoperative capsular bag ruptures.
In all patients of the 1st group, capsulorhexis of the correct round shape and the required diameter was achieved, allowing the use of modern methods of fixation and centering of the capsular bag. Insignificant tear of the edge of the capsulorhexis after IOL implantation was detected only in 1 (2.2%) patient. Vitreous prolapse was noted in 1 (2.2%) case. In the 2nd group, manual technique resulted in oval capsulorhexis with a smooth edge, allowing the use of modern methods of fixation of the capsular bag only in 7 (21.2%) cases. Vitreous prolapse was noted in 4 (12.1%) cases. The complete in-the-bag IOL implantation was possible in 44 (97.8%) cases in the 1st group and only in 7 (21.2%) in the 2nd group.
The use of femtosecond laser in patients with hypermature cataract and lens subluxation allows achieving capsulorhexis of ideally round shape with a smooth edge. This creates the necessary conditions for the use of modern methods of fixation of the capsular bag and provides the possibility of complete all-in-the-bag IOL implantation.

To develop a technique for hybrid (femtosecond laser-assisted) phacoemulsification in patients with a combination of hypermature cataract, small pupil and lens subluxation.
Hybrid (femtosecond laser-assisted) phacoemulsification of hypermature cataracts was performed in 36 patients (36 eyes) aged 63 to 78 years with grade I-II lens subluxation in combination with small pupil. The initial circular femtolaser capsulotomy was performed within the small pupil using the VICTUS system (Technolas Perfect Vision, Germany). After dilating the pupil with retractor hooks, the capsulorhexis was manually expanded to the required diameter.
In all cases, the resulting capsulorhexis had a regular round shape with a smooth edge, without radial ruptures. This made it possible to apply modern methods of fixation and centration of the capsular bag in case of lens subluxation and to perform intracapsular implantation of an intraocular lens (IOL). Complete intracapsular fixation of the IOL with optics edge fully covered by the edge of the capsulorhexis in the postoperative period was achieved in 34 (94.4%) cases. In 2 (5.6%) cases in the postoperative period, the edge of the capsulorhexis exceeded the edge of the IOL optics. The loss of corneal endothelial cells 3 months after surgery was 8.8±1.9%.
The use of the proposed combined technique of capsulorhexis made it possible to perform the most physiologically appropriate intracapsular IOL implantation in all patients with hypermature cataract, small pupil and lens subluxation.

However, there are few reports on CCS-induced deformation of the IOL optic. We report two cases of CCS after cataract surgery in highly myopic eyes and describe a previously unreported ""double arch"" complication.
Two patients with history of high myopia had cataract surgery with hydrophilic acrylic plate haptic IOLs implanted in their eyes. CCS with arch shape deformation of the pupil as well as the optic of the IOL were noticed in both cases after three months, which induced refractive changes and corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) deterioration. Visual acuity of the patients was restored by replacing the IOL from the capsular bag to the ciliary sulcus and the following neodymium: YAG (Nd:YAG) laser capsulotomy. We propose that such ""double arch"" change brought by CCS is related to the plate-haptic design of the IOL and the incomplete overlap between the capsular opening and the IOL optic.

102;34662920;Adapted Bag-in-the-Lens Implantation Technique in Children with Congenital Ectopia Lentis.;[];Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde;"Subluxation of the crystalline lens in childhood confronts the surgeon with a dilemma: to operate or to wait and see. Surgery is usually not performed when the subluxation is still limited. However, postponing the surgery increases the surgical difficulty as the capsular bag becomes more difficult to use as a means of support for the intraocular lens (IOL). A large number of children already present a pronounced subluxation at first presentation. In this paper, we describe a technique to optimise centration and fixation of the bag-in-the-lens (BIL) IOL in children younger than 7 years of age with congenital ectopia lentis.
Between October 2019 and December 2020, we performed lens extraction using a combination of bean-shaped segments to support the BIL IOL and a 6 - 0 polypropylene loop fixated at the sclera, following the Yamane technique, for the purpose of centration. We used this technique for seven eyes of four patients. The patients were between 2 and 6 years old; 3 boys and 1 girl. A definite diagnosis of Marfan syndrome was made for two children; for the other two, there was no proven underlying pathology. The luxation was upwards in all cases. The degree of luxation was severe in all eyes. The preoperative refraction values showed high astigmatism values for all eyes, ranging from 6.5 to 11.25 dioptres. Three out of the four patients were myopic, ranging from - 1.5 to - 9 dioptres.
The surgery could be performed without major complications in all eyes. Good centration was obtained, which remained stable in the postoperative period. Refraction improved with greatly diminished degrees of astigmatism (ranging from 0.25 to 3 dioptres) and myopia (spheres ranging from - 2 to + 1.75 dioptres).
Our novel technique incorporated the BIL technique with the addition of bean-shaped segments and a polypropylene 6/0 suture fixated at the sclera. In this way, we were able to obtain good centration and stability of the implanted IOL, as well as a good refractive outcome in all cases.
Die Subluxation der Augenlinse im Kindesalter stellt den Chirurgen vor ein Dilemma: operieren oder abwarten und sehen. Eine Operation wird normalerweise nicht durchgeführt, wenn die Subluxation noch begrenzt ist. Die Verschiebung der Operation erhöht jedoch die chirurgische Schwierigkeit, da die Verwendung des Kapselsacks als Mittel zur Unterstützung der IOL schwieriger wird. Eine große Anzahl von Kindern zeigt bereits bei ihrem ersten Besuch eine ausgeprägte Subluxation. Wir beschreiben eine Technik zur Optimierung der Zentrierung und Fixierung der Intraokularlinse (IOL) mit Bag in the Lens (BIL) bei Kindern unter 7 Jahren mit angeborener Ectopia lentis.
Zwischen Oktober 2019 und Dezember 2020 führten wir eine Linsenextraktion durch, wobei wir eine Kombination aus bohnenförmigen Segmenten zur Unterstützung der BIL-IOL und einer 6 – 0-Polypropylenschlaufe benutzten, die zum Zweck der Zentrierung nach der Yamane-Technik an der Sklera fixiert wurde. Wir verwendeten diese Technik für 7 Augen von 4 Patienten. Die Patienten waren zwischen 2 und 6 Jahre alt; 3 Jungen und 1 Mädchen. Eine eindeutige Diagnose des Marfan-Syndroms wurde für 2 Kinder gestellt, für die anderen 2 gab es keine nachgewiesene zugrunde liegende Pathologie. Die Luxation war in allen Fällen nach oben gerichtet. Der Luxationsgrad war in allen Augen stark ausgeprägt. Die präoperativen Refraktionswerte zeigten für alle Augen hohe Astigmatismuswerte im Bereich von 6,5 bis 11,25 dpt. Drei der 4 Patienten waren kurzsichtig und reichten von − 1,5 bis − 9 dpt.
Die Operation konnte in allen Augen ohne größere Komplikationen durchgeführt werden. Es wurde eine gute Zentrierung erreicht, die in der postoperativen Phase stabil blieb. Die Refraktion verbesserte sich mit stark verringertem Astigmatismus (im Bereich von 0,25 bis 3 dpt) und Myopie (Sphären im Bereich von − 2 bis + 1,75 dpt).

Pediatric aphakic eyes underwent in-the-bag or ciliary sulcus secondary IOL implantation according to the amount of residual lens capsule and were monitored for 3 years postoperatively. The main outcome measures were adverse events (AEs), IOL tilt and decentration, and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the operative eye.

104;34636992;Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery versus conventional phacoemulsification: comparison of internal aberrations and visual quality.;['Conventional phacoemulsification cataract surgery', 'Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery', 'Higher-order aberration', 'Optical quality', 'Wavefront aberration'];Graefe's archive for clinical and experimental ophthalmology = Albrecht von Graefes Archiv fur klinische und experimentelle Ophthalmologie;"To compare the internal aberrations and optical quality after femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) and conventional phacoemulsification cataract surgery (CPCS).
This study included patients who received FLACS or CPCS from January 2016 to July 2019. Postoperative examinations included wavefront measurements under pupil diameters of 3.0 mm and 5.0 mm, intraocular lens (IOL) decentration, visual acuity (VA), and refractive outcomes. Visual quality was measured with Strehl ratio and modulation transfer function (MTF). Subgroup analyses were conducted based on monofocal or multifocal-extended depth of focus (EDOF) IOL.
The study consisted of 221 eyes (105 eyes in FLACS and 116 eyes in CPCS). With a pupil diameter of 5.0 mm, FLACS demonstrated a significantly lower root mean square of total internal aberration (P = 0.004), higher order aberrations (HOAs) (P = 0.034), tilt (P = 0.049), coma (P = 0.004), and spherical aberration (P = 0.014). IOL tilt was found to be positively correlated with total internal aberration (P < 0.001), HOAs (P < 0.001), and coma (P < 0.001). The FLACS group presented significantly smaller IOL decentration than the CPCS group (P < 0.001), but there were no significant differences in terms of VA and refractive outcomes between groups. In the multifocal-EDOF subgroup, Strehl ratio and MTF values were significantly higher in the femtosecond group with a 3.0-mm pupil.
FLACS induced significantly lower values of IOL tilt, decentration, and internal aberrations compared with the CPCS group with a pupil diameter of 5.0 mm, while no significant differences were found in the VA or optical quality over long-term observation.

Retrospective, consecutive case series study.
Thirty-six PIOL implanted eyes (12 anterior chamber PIOLs and 24 posterior chamber PIOLs [PC-PIOL]) undergoing cataract surgery were included. The prediction accuracy of new formulas (Barrett universal II, Emmetropia verifying optical, Kane, and Ladas super formula) and traditional formulas (Haigis, Hoffer Q, Holladay 1 and SRK/T) with or without Wang-Koch (WK) axial length (AL) adjustment was evaluated. The influence of ACD and LT measurement errors of IOLMaster 700 on refractive outcomes was also investigated.
The Kane and traditional formulas with WK AL adjustment had no significant systematic prediction error and displayed a smaller median absolute error, whereas the other formulas showed significant hyperopia shift (P < .05) and relatively lower prediction accuracy. The accuracy rate of IOLMaster 700 in measuring the ACD and LT was 100% in eyes with anterior chamber PIOL implantation, and 37.50% in the PC-PIOL subgroup.

107;34582764;Patient Experience and Satisfaction With Immediate Sequential and Delayed Sequential Bilateral Cataract Surgery.;[];American journal of ophthalmology;"In bilaterally pseudophakic patients who received immediate or delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery (ISBCS or DSBCS), we sought to determine patient experience, particularly related to the loss of opportunity to modify the surgical plan for the second eye.
Cross-sectional.
Patients who received ISBCS (n = 1818) and DSBCS (n = 1818) in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California system between 2017 and 2019 who actively used the electronic patient portal were randomly selected and sent a survey link. The survey inquired about reasons for choosing ISBCS or DSBCS, concerns about surgery, and whether the loss of opportunity to modify the surgical plan for the second eye affected the patient's decision to undergo ISBCS.
Participation was 18% among patients who received ISBCS and 17% among patients who received DSBCS. Of the patients who received ISBCS, 96% would choose ISBCS again while 80% of patients who received DSBCS would choose DSBCS again (P < .0001). Convenience was the leading reason patients chose ISBCS (65%), whereas surgeon recommendation was the primary reason patients chose DSBCS (68%).

We performed a modified technique of capsular bag lavage in 11 eyes with late-onset PCO after EK (4 cases: post-DSAEK, 7 cases: post-DMEK). Anterior capsular rim was separated from the underlying IOL optic using MVR blade. Circumferential relaxing radial nicks were made on the capsular rim to create space for the passage of irrigation-aspiration (IA) probes behind the IOL. Bimanual IA of the flocculent cortical material was performed without damaging the posterior capsule. Air was injected at end of surgery to ensure graft apposition. All cases gained 1-3 lines of Snellen's acuity and no case developed graft failure, rejection, or endothelial decompensation. An intact posterior capsule is associated with better outcomes post a repeat graft, if required.

40 eyes of patients indicated for cataract surgery were included in this study. Each patient was examined by optical biometer firstly without artificial mydriasis (AM) and then after AM, which was achieved using local application of short-term acting mydriatics. Biometric data were measured by Lenstar LS 900 optical biometer, we recorded axial length of the eye (AL), central corneal thickness (CCT), anterior chamber depth (ACD), lens thickness (LT) and corneal astigmatism and optical power of cornea. These data we measured were used for calculation of the PC IOL optical power using both the SRK/T and the Haigis formula. The target postoperative refraction was set to emmetropia. Statistical analysis was performed for evaluation of influence of AM on each ocular parameter and influence of AM on the recommended PC IOL power calculated by the SRK/T and the Haigis formula.
No statistically significant effect of AM on AL, LT and keratometry was demonstrated. On the contrary we demonstrated significant effect on CCT and ACD. No effect of AM on the PC IOL power calculation using the SRK/T formula was proved - the PC IOL optical power before AM and after AM did not differ in any case.

P1 and P4 Purkinje reflections at patient fixation may provide a reliable marker for capsulotomy centration. However, patient fixation may be hindered during surgery because of anesthesia or light sensitivity. In this study, we demonstrate that the relationship between the P1 and P4 Purkinje reflections previewed prior to surgery when the patient is fixating may be recreated intraoperatively if fixation becomes difficult. The final position of P1 and P4 relative to one another at fixation is invariant in a given patient, but there are variations among patients.

This study included 51 pediatric patients who underwent cataract surgery between April 2016 and December 2018. Video recordings and OCT images of the VLI were analyzed and compared. VLI dysgenesis was considered present when intraoperative OCT images demonstrated partial or total adhesions between the posterior lens capsule and the anterior hyaloid membrane. Video recordings were analyzed to describe surgical difficulties, more specifically: inability to create a calibrated primary posterior continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (PPCCC), occurrence of vitreous prolapse, need for anterior vitrectomy, and complicated IOL implantation.
Of the 51 patients included, VLI dysgenesis was demonstrated in 27 patients (52.9%). The incidence of VLI dysgenesis was greater in children with unilateral cataract (72.4%), and children with a posterior capsule plaque (90%). PPCCC was challenging in 20 patients. A defect of the anterior hyaloid membrane was found in 16 patients. Anterior vitrectomy or cutting vitreous strands with scissors was necessary in 10 patients.

Surgical removal of cataracts is a safe and effective procedure to restore vision. However, a large number of patients later develop vision loss due to regrowth of lens cells and subsequent degradation of the visual axis leading to visual disability. This postsurgical complication, known as posterior capsular opacification (PCO), occurs in up to 30% of cataract patients and has no clinically proven pharmacological means of prevention. Despite the availability of many compounds capable of preventing early steps in PCO development, there is currently no effective means to deliver such therapies into the eye for a suitable duration. To model a solution to this unmet medical need, we fabricated acrylic substrates as intraocular lens (IOL) mimics scaled to place into the capsular bag of the mouse lens following a mock-cataract surgery. Substrates were coated with a hydrophilic crosslinked acrylate nanogel designed to elute Sorbinil, an aldose reductase inhibitor previously shown to suppress PCO. Insertion of the Sorbinil-eluting device into the lens capsule at the time of cataract surgery resulted in substantial prevention of cellular changes associated with PCO development.

One hundred two eyes of 70 patients who underwent implantation of the transitional toric 565 Precizon IOL (Ophtec BV) were enrolled. FLACS, capsular tension ring insertion, and intraoperative aberrometry were performed. Main outcome measures were refractive error, uncorrected- and corrected distance snellen decimal visual acuity values (UDVA and CDVA, respectively), and IOL rotation. Specifically, a vector analysis was carried out with J0 and J45 evaluation. Eyes were evaluated 1-year after surgery.
Overall, 94.12% (96 eyes) and 100% (102 eyes) of the eyes showed a spherical equivalent (SE) within ± 0.50D and ± 1.00D, respectively. The mean SE and refractive cylinder were - 0.06 ± 0.29D and - 0.23 ± 0.37D, respectively. Vector analysis revealed that 100% of the eyes were within ± 0.50D for the J0 and J45 cylindrical components. The mean toric axis rotation was 1.10 ± 1.71° (from 0° to 5°), 77% (79 eyes), and 100% (102 eyes) of the eyes showed UDVA and CDVA of 20/25, respectively. The postoperative mean values of monocular UDVA and CDVA were 0.88 ± 0.17 and 0.96 ± 0.07 (about 20/20), respectively. No patient required IOL realignment during the postoperative follow-up.

Retrospective, single-center, observational study.
All eyes undergoing cataract surgery with a monofocal, toric, or enhanced depth-of-focus (EDoF) Synthesis (Cutting Edge) IOL between August 2019 and March 2020 were reviewed. Data were collected on the surgical procedure, postoperative course, time until onset of symptoms, clinical features, and additional treatments. A laboratory surface analysis of all 3 IOL subtypes was performed in the Intermountain Ocular Research Center at the University of Utah, USA. Furthermore, other possible causes of prolonged postoperative inflammation rather than the IOL itself were investigated.
Among the 203 eyes included, 28 TASS cases were identified (13.8%), among which 25 received a monofocal IOL, and 3 received an EDoF IOL. The mean time until onset was 28.9 (±19.9) days. Patients presented with anterior chamber cells (92.9%), deposits on the IOL (57.1%), or fibrinous inflammation (35.7%). 4 eyes (14.3%) underwent a surgical intervention, whereas 24 eyes showed a resolution of inflammation with topical therapy alone. Laboratory analysis showed the presence of both aluminum and silicon particles on the monofocal IOL, silicon particles only on the EDoF IOL, and no particles on the toric IOL surface.

Retrospective multicentric dataset study.
A polynomial regression formula, WeOptimeye2nd (WO2nd), was developed using a machine-learning algorithm trained on a dataset of 534 patients who underwent sequential bilateral cataract surgery. A separate multicentric dataset was used to retrospectively calculate predicted refraction with WO2nd, SRK/T and Barrett Universal II formulas, and 3 other methods of constant factors (CFs) second-eye refinement (CF0.38, CF0.35, and CF0.5). Mean absolute errors (MAEs) and percentage of eyes within ±0.25, ±0.5, and ±1.0 diopter (D) from predicted spherical equivalent were compared between formulas.
The study comprised data on 722 patients. In the overall population, WO2nd had the lowest MAE: 0.339 vs 0.347 (P = .137), 0.340 (P = .956), 0.350 (P = .066), 0.399 (P < .001), and 0.410 (P < .001), with CF0.38, CF0.5, and CF0.35, Barrett II, and SRK/T, respectively.

We conducted: 1) a retrospective cohort study of patient eyes undergoing phacoemulsification at our institution; and 2) laboratory investigation of the effect of metformin on the behavior of lens epithelial cells in the context of an animal model for PCO. Population-averaged Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to estimate risk for time to Nd:YAG. For laboratory studies, expression of markers for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) implicated in PCO pathogenesis was measured in tissue culture and following extracapsular lens extraction in a mouse model.
The rate of Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy was 13.1% among the 9798 eyes. Both metformin use and diabetes were protective factors for Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy in univariate analysis. However, in multivariable analysis with nondiabetics as the reference group, only metformin use among diabetics was significantly protective of Nd:YAG (hazard ratio: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.54-0.85, P = 0.0008), while eyes of patients with diabetes without metformin use did not significantly differ (P = 0.5026). Treatment of lens epithelial cells with metformin reduced the level of the EMT markers ⍺-SMA and pERK induced by TGF-β2. Similarly, metformin treatment reduced ⍺-SMA expression in lens epithelial cells following extracapsular lens extraction in a mouse model.
The protective effect of metformin against early Nd:YAG may relate to its ability to downregulate EMT in residual lens epithelial cells that otherwise trend toward myofibroblast development and PCO.";;;;;10.1167/iovs.62.10.24;2021-08-21;[{'lastname': 'Patnaik', 'firstname': 'Jennifer L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Christopher', 'firstname': 'Karen L', 'initials': 'KL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Pedler', 'firstname': 'Michelle G', 'initials': 'MG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Shieh', 'firstname': 'Biehuoy', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Petrash', 'firstname': 'Carson C', 'initials': 'CC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Wagner', 'firstname': 'Brandie D', 'initials': 'BD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics, Colorado School of Public Health, Aurora, Colorado, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Mandava', 'firstname': 'Naresh', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Lynch', 'firstname': 'Anne M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Palestine', 'firstname': 'Alan G', 'initials': 'AG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Petrash', 'firstname': 'J Mark', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, United States.'}]

Intraocular lens explantation can be challenging for a number of reasons and as such we have introduced an additional technique to add to the surgeon's repertoire. Bimanual haptic stripping of fibrosis at the specific area where the haptic is adherent to the capsular bag is an effective strategy to aid in dissection of haptics without compromising the capsule or zonules. Given the challenges associated with IOL explantation, newly designed IOLs need to avoid these ""sticking points"" at which the IOLs interact with the fibrosed capsule.

Using this system, we examined the influence of temperature (room temperature vs. body temperature) and incubation time (0 vs. 24 h) on the adhesion force between IOLs and LCs. The results show that, in line with clinical observations of PCO incidence, the adhesion force increased at body temperature and with increase in incubation time in the following order, Acrylic foldable IOLs > Silicone IOLs > PMMA IOLs. By examining the changes of surface properties as a function of temperature and incubation time, we found that acrylic foldable IOLs showed the largest increase in their hydrophilicity and reported the lowest surface roughness in comparison to other IOL groups. Coincidentally, using a newly established macromolecular dye imaging system to simulate cell migration between IOLs and LC, we observed that the amount of macromolecular dye infiltration between IOLs and LCs was in the following order: PMMA IOLs > Silicone IOLs > Acrylic foldable IOLs. These results support a new potential mechanism that body temperature, incubation time, surface hydrophilicity and smoothness of IOLs greatly contribute to their tight binding to LCs and such tight binding may lead to reduced IOL: LC space, cell infiltration, and thus PCO formation.;;;;Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

127;34398965;Intraocular lens optic edge design for the prevention of posterior capsule opacification after cataract surgery.;[];The Cochrane database of systematic reviews;"Posterior capsule opacification (PCO) is a clouding of the posterior part of the lens capsule, a skin-like transparent structure, which surrounds the crystalline lens in the human eye. PCO is the most common postoperative complication following modern cataract surgery with implantation of a posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL). The main symptoms of PCO are a decrease in visual acuity, 'cloudy', blurred vision and reduced contrast sensitivity. PCO is treated with a neodymium:YAG (Nd:YAG) laser to create a small opening in the opaque capsule and regain a clear central visual axis. This capsulotomy might cause further ocular complications, such as raised intraocular pressure or swelling of the central retina (macular oedema). This procedure is also a significant financial burden for health care systems worldwide. In recent decades, there have been advances in the selection of IOL materials and optimisation of IOL designs to help prevent PCO formation after cataract surgery. These include changes to the side structures holding the lens in the centre of the lens capsule bag, called IOL haptics, and IOL optic edge designs.
To compare the effects of different IOL optic edge designs on PCO after cataract surgery.
We searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS), the ISRCTN registry, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) up to 17 November 2020.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different types of IOL optic edge design. Our prespecified primary outcome was the proportion of eyes with Nd:YAG capsulotomy one year after surgery. Secondary outcomes included PCO score, best-corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) and quality of life score at one year. Due to availability of important long-term data, we also presented data at longer-term follow-up which is a post hoc change to our protocol.
We used standard methods expected by Cochrane and the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence.
We included 10 studies (1065 people, 1834 eyes) that compared sharp- and round-edged IOLs. Eight of these studies were within-person studies whereby one eye received a sharp-edged IOL and the fellow eye a round-edged IOL. The IOL materials were acrylic (2 studies), silicone (4 studies), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA, 3 studies) and different materials (1 study). The studies were conducted in Austria, Germany, India, Japan, Sweden and the UK. Five studies were at high risk of bias in at least one domain. We judged two studies to be at low risk of bias in all domains. There were few cases of Nd:YAG capsulotomy at one year (primary outcome): 1/371 in sharp-edged and 4/371 in round-edged groups. The effect estimate was in favour of sharp-edged IOLs but the confidence intervals were very wide and compatible with higher or lower chance of Nd:YAG capsulotomy in sharp-edged compared with round-edged lenses (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.30, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.74; I
This review provides evidence that sharp-edged IOLs are likely to be associated with less PCO formation than round-edged IOLs, with less Nd:YAG capsulotomy. The effects on visual acuity were less certain. The impact of these lenses on quality of life has not been assessed and there are only very low-certainty comparative data on adverse events.";;;;Copyright © 2021 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Poor visual function related to cataracts is also a risk factor for falls and traffic accidents, which may lead to hospital admissions and limit independence.
To evaluate patients' satisfaction, visual functions and spectacle independence among patients in the Central Region of Ghana who had cataract surgery in one eye.
A hospital-based prospective cohort study was carried out on 146 patients booked for cataract surgery: 16 were lost through follow-ups whilst 130 completed the study. Visual functions including visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, stereopsis and colour vision were assessed before and after a month of cataract surgery. Objective and subjective refractions were performed to determine the post-surgery refractive status of the participants. Participants completed the NEI-VFQ 25 questionnaire and the scores obtained were used as a construct of their satisfaction.
The NEI-VFQ 25 questionnaire scores indicated patients' satisfaction was high with an average quality of life score of 77.46. Patients satisfaction was strongly correlated with contrast sensitivity (r=0.653, p<0.001) but moderately correlated with visual acuity (r=-0.554, p<0.001), stereopsis (r=0.490, p<0.001) and colour vision (r=0.466, p<0.001). Contrast sensitivity was a better predictor of patients' satisfaction than visual acuity and stereopsis. Spectacle independence at distance was achieved in only 44.6% of the participants and 5.4% at near. There was a significant (p>0.001) association between spectacle independence and the two types of cataract surgery performed which included Small Incision Cataract Surgery (SICS) and Extracapsular Cataract Extraction (ECCE). Among those who were spectacle independent, 53.4% of them were low vision patients.

We identified patients with preoperative corneal astigmatism from + 0.75 to + 2.00 diopters (D) who had undergone astigmatic correction with FLACS with ISAK or toric IOL implantation with conventional phacoemulsification. We measured the visual acuity, intraocular pressure, automated keratometer, manifest refraction, and topography preoperatively and 1-day, 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month postoperatively. The vector analysis of refractive astigmatism was performed.

134;34373536;Delayed vitreous prolapse after cataract surgery: clinical features and surgical outcomes.;[];Scientific reports;"This study investigates the etiology and clinical features of delayed vitreous prolapse after cataract surgery and evaluates the long-term surgical and visual outcomes. Consecutive patients with vitreous prolapse into the anterior chamber occurring ≥ 3 months after cataract surgery at two hospitals between December 2006 and June 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. The primary outcome was associated ophthalmological events that triggered delayed vitreous prolapse. Secondary outcomes included long-term visual and subjective symptom changes after treatment. Among 20 eyes (20 patients), all had visual symptoms, the most common being blurry vision (12 patients; 60%). Five (25%) were detected after YAG laser capsulotomy, three (15%) had a history of intraocular lens(IOL) implantation in sulcus due to intraoperative posterior capsular tears, three (15%) had prolapsed vitreous alongside dislocated IOLs, and three (15%) were aphakic after previous cataract surgeries. After surgical treatment, the mean corrected distance visual acuity improved from 20/50 to 20/31(P = 0.02) and the mean preoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) that was 26.4 mmHg decreased to 15.6 mmHg, remaining stable until the last follow-up. All reported symptoms were relieved. YAG laser capsulotomy or a history of defective posterior capsule from iatrogenic causes may trigger delayed vitreous prolapse. The long-term outcomes were favorable, particularly after posterior vitrectomy, with improved IOP control and symptom resolution.";;;;© 2021.

Demographic characteristics, trauma zone, ocular trauma score, type of injury, time of secondary IOL implantation, final best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and complications were recorded for each patient.
The mean follow-up time of 62 patients was 25.05 ± 12.59 months. The preoperative BCVA was found to be 2.40 ± 0.86 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR), while the postoperative final BCVA was found to be 0.53 ± 0.70 logMAR (p &lt; 0.01). The mean interval timing of secondary sulcus foldable IOL implantation was determined to be 3.79 ± 4.04 months.

The files of the 26 patients that had an iris claw IOL implantation between 2010 and 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Detailed ophthalmological examination findings including corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), intraocular pressure, endothelial cell counts, slit lamp and dilated fundus examination findings were specifically tabulated. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were also specifically recorded.
There were 18 patients in the prepupillary implantation group and eight patients in the retropupillary implantation group. Age and gender distribution were similar between the groups. CDVA significantly increased in prepupillary and retropupillary implantation groups (p = 0.001 and p = 0.012, respectively). Median endothelial cell loss was 6.7% in prepupillary group and 7.2% in retropupillary group. The only intraoperative complication was iridodialysis (n = 1). Postoperative complications included retinal detachment (n = 1), cystoid macular edema (n = 2) and IOL tilt (n = 1). All of these complications occurred in the prepupillary implantation group.

A total of 52 eyes of 52 children who underwent cataract surgery and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in previously vitrectomized eyes between January 2008 and December 2017 were included in this retrospective study. Descriptive and inferential statistical measurements (Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, odds ratio, multiple logistic regression) were done.
The mean age at PPV was 11.3 ± 2.9 years. The most common indication for PPV was retinal detachment in 43 eyes (82.69%) and vitreous hemorrhage in 6 eyes (11.53%). The mean preoperative and postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 1.31 ± 0.48 logMAR (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) units (20/400) and 0.69 ± 0.45 logMAR units (20/100), respectively; P < 0.001.

For patients with additional lens opacification, a 1-stage procedure with combined cataract surgery is recommended.
The aim of this retrospective study was to record the functional results and complications after elective macular surgery with and without combined phacoemulsification and artificial lens implantation.
The retrospective study included all patients who were operated on with a pars plana vitrectomy (ppV; 25 gauge) for epiretinal membrane, macular hole or vitreoretinal traction between 2010 and 2016 and who had a follow-up period of at least 3 months. The functional results and possible risk factors as well as complications that occurred were then recorded.
A total of 781 eyes were identified of which 517 (66%) had a phacoemulsification and artificial lens implantation with a 25-gauge vitrectomy, membranectomy, ILM peeling and SF6 gas or air tamponade. The mean follow-up time was 17 months. The mean logMAR visual acuity was 0.59 preoperatively and 0.4 postoperatively. From 64 phacic eyes which did not receive a combined phacoemulsification and artificial lens implantation 40 (62.5%) required phacoemulsification and artificial lens implantation within 13.6 months due to complicated cataract, 18 even within 6 months. In terms of complications, there were comparable results between ppV alone and the combined operation, particularly with respect to an IOL dislocation or iris capture.
Overall elective macular surgery is a procedure with few complications both without and above all with combined phacoemulsification and artificial lens implantation. Therefore, a combined operation makes sense in terms of surgical management and postoperative rehabilitation, especially in times of a pandemic with limited surgical resources.

In die Studie wurden retrospektiv alle Patienten eingeschlossen, die im Zeitraum von 2010 bis 2016 mittels Pars-plana-Vitrektomie (ppV; 25 Gauge) an der Makula aufgrund einer epiretinalen Gliose, eines Makulaforamens oder einer vitreoretinalen Traktion operiert wurden und eine Nachbeobachtungszeit von mindestens 3 Monaten aufwiesen. Die Operationen wurden von einem Operateur durchgeführt. Anschließend erfolgte eine Analyse der funktionellen Ergebnisse, möglicher Risikofaktoren sowie aufgetretener Komplikationen.
Eingeschlossen wurden insgesamt 781 Augen, von denen 517 (66 %) kombiniert mit Phakoemulsifikation, Kunstlinsenimplantation und 25-Gauge-ppV, Membranektomie, ILM-Peeling und SF6-Gas oder Luft operiert wurden. Die mittlere Nachbeobachtungszeit lag bei 17 Monaten. Der mittlere logMar-Visus präoperativ betrug 0,59, postoperativ 0,4; 200 Patienten waren bereits pseudophak. Bei 64 phaken Augen erfolgte keine kombinierte Operation, 40 (62,5 %) davon benötigten aufgrund einer Cataracta complicata innerhalb von 13,6 Monaten eine Phakoemulsifikation mit Kunstlinsenimplantation, 18 sogar innerhalb von 6 Monaten. Bei den Komplikationen zeigten sich vergleichbare Ergebnisse zwischen der alleinigen ppV und der kombinierten Operation insbesondere hinsichtlich IOL-Dislokation oder Iriscapture.
Insgesamt ist die elektive Makulachirurgie sowohl ohne, v. a. aber auch mit kombinierter Phakoemulsifikation und Kunstlinsenimplantation ein komplikationsarmes Operationsverfahren, sodass im Hinblick auf das Operationsmanagement und die postoperative Rehabilitation eine kombinierte Operation insbesondere in Zeiten einer Pandemie gegenüber einem zweizeitigem Vorgehen bevorzugt werden sollte.";Overall elective macular surgery is a procedure with few complications both without and above all with combined phacoemulsification and artificial lens implantation. Therefore, a combined operation makes sense in terms of surgical management and postoperative rehabilitation, especially in times of a pandemic with limited surgical resources.;;A total of 781 eyes were identified of which 517 (66%) had a phacoemulsification and artificial lens implantation with a 25-gauge vitrectomy, membranectomy, ILM peeling and SF6 gas or air tamponade. The mean follow-up time was 17 months. The mean logMAR visual acuity was 0.59 preoperatively and 0.4 postoperatively. From 64 phacic eyes which did not receive a combined phacoemulsification and artificial lens implantation 40 (62.5%) required phacoemulsification and artificial lens implantation within 13.6 months due to complicated cataract, 18 even within 6 months. In terms of complications, there were comparable results between ppV alone and the combined operation, particularly with respect to an IOL dislocation or iris capture.;© 2021.

In this case report, we describe an unusual case of ILM in a 76-year-old woman whose ILM had formed between her primary intracapsular IOL and her piggyback sulcal IOL. Furthermore, we describe vitreoretinal interlenticular membranectomy (VIM), a novel technique involving a translimbal anterior interlenticular membranectomy using vitreoretinal instrumentation. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. Postoperative best-corrected visual acuity was 6/4, maintained for 3 years of follow-up.

It is classically divided into fibrotic type and regenerative type according to clinical manifestations or pathological mechanisms. The widely used technique for preventing PCO is to mechanically polish anterior and posterior capsules after an uneventful phacoemulsification surgery. However, the efficacy of polishing anterior capsules on prevention of PCO is debatable. It has been found that polishing anterior capsules has an inhibitory or no effect on fibrotic PCO, but a stimulating effect on regenerative PCO. Therefore, whether to polish anterior capsules is dependent on the condition of individual patients and the type of intraocular lenses. 
后发性白内障（PCO）是白内障患者术后视力下降最常见的并发症。PCO不论按照临床表现还是病理机制均可分为纤维型和再生型。目前临床最常用的预防PCO的技术为术中机械性晶状体前后囊膜抛光，但是否有效预防PCO一直存在分歧。进一步的研究发现晶状体前囊膜抛光对纤维型PCO有抑制作用或没有作用，而对再生型PCO很可能有促进作用。因此，是否行晶状体前囊膜抛光应该根据患者具体情况以及植入人工晶状体类型而定。";;;;;10.3760/cma.j.cn112142-20201013-00681;2021-07-15;"[{'lastname': 'Yan', 'firstname': 'H', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': ""Shaanxi Eye Hospital, Xi'an People's Hospital (Xi'an Fourth Hospital), Affiliated Guangren Hospital, School of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710004, ChinaCorrespongding author: Yan Hong, Email: yan2128ts@hotmail.com.""}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Y', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Shaanxi Eye Hospital, Xi'an People's Hospital (Xi'an Fourth Hospital), Affiliated Guangren Hospital, School of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an 710004, ChinaCorrespongding author: Yan Hong, Email: yan2128ts@hotmail.com.""}]"

But IOL implantation in infants and young children, especially under 1 year old, is still controversy. Large-scale, multi-center, randomly controlled clinical observations on this issue have been conducted. The mid-and long-term results have shown that infantile cataract extraction combined with primary IOL implantation can achieve the same or better visual outcome as aphakic contact lens correction. For infants over 7 months of age and young children, primary implantation of IOLs is relatively safe, with a low complication and secondary operation rate. Compared to the way of aphakic contact lens correction, which could be with more inconvenience, high demand of coordination, a higher infection risk, high cost and the need of a secondary IOL implantation surgery, primary implantation of IOLs at over 7 months of age is worth exploring, with appropriate understanding of the surgical indications and adequate surgical techniques.

Twenty-six children (47 eyes) with congenital ectopia lentis were included in this study. The mean age at surgery was 61.6 ± 22.3 months (range, 32-94). Patients underwent lens extraction, anterior vitrectomy, and sutured scleral fixation of posterior chamber IOL. The implanted IOL included rigid polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) IOL (CZ70BD, n = 36) and foldable IOL (SA60AT, n = 9, and LI61SE, n = 2). The outcome measures used to assess the benefits were uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), refraction, intraocular pressure, and any associated complications. Median follow-up was 33.0 months (range, 4-129).
After surgery, the median UCVA (1.30 vs. 0.35 logMAR) and BCVA (0.82 vs. 0.15 logMAR) improved significantly (p < 0.001). The median absolute spherical values decreased considerably (9.00 vs. 0.75 D; p < 0.001).

Therefore, a comparative analysis of visual acuity outcomes after immediate sequential bilateral cataract surgery (ISBCS) vs delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery (DSBCS) is important for informing future best practices.
To compare refractive outcomes of patients who underwent ISBCS, short-interval (1-14 days between operations) DSBCS (DSBCS-14), and long-interval (15-90 days) DSBCS (DSBCS-90) procedures.
This retrospective cohort study used population-based data from the American Academy of Ophthalmology Intelligent Research in Sight (IRIS) Registry. A total of 1 824 196 IRIS Registry participants with bilateral visual acuity measurements who underwent bilateral cataract surgery were assessed.
Participants were divided into 3 groups (DSBCS-90, DSBCS-14, and ISBCS groups) based on the timing of the second eye surgery. Univariable and multivariable linear regression models were used to analyze the refractive outcomes of the first and second surgery eye.

Compared with the DSBCS-90 group, after age, self-reported race, insurance status, history of age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma were controlled for, the UCVA of the first surgical eye was higher by 0.41 (95% CI, 0.36-0.45; P < .001) letters, and the BCVA was higher by 0.89 (95% CI, 0.86-0.92; P < .001) letters in the DSBCS-14 group, whereas in the ISBCS group, the UCVA was lower by 2.79 (95% CI, -2.95 to -2.63; P < .001) letters and the BCVA by 1.64 (95% CI, -1.74 to -1.53; P < .001) letters. Similarly, compared with the DSBCS-90 group for the second eye, in the DSBCS-14 group, the UCVA was higher by 0.79 (95% CI, 0.74-0.83; P < .001) letters and the BCVA by 0.48 (95% CI, 0.45-0.51; P < .001) letters, whereas in the ISBCS group, the UCVA was lower by -1.67 (95% CI, -1.83 to -1.51; P < .001) letters and the BCVA by -1.88 (95% CI, -1.98 to -1.78; P < .001) letters.
The results of this cohort study of patients in the IRIS Registry suggest that compared with DSBCS-14 or DSBCS-90, ISBCS is associated with worse visual outcomes, which may or may not be clinically relevant, depending on patients' additional risk factors.

Prospective case series.
Toric IOL implantation was offered to patients with cataract, corneal astigmatism >1.5 diopters (D) and regular central corneal topography after complete suture removal. Phacoemulsification was performed through a 2.4 mm scleral tunnel and an enVista monofocal toric MX60T or Eyecryl monofocal toric IOL was inserted in the capsular bag. Main outcome measures were uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), manifest refraction, total prediction error, and IOL misalignment.
37 consecutive patients who had previously undergone either DALK (n = 27, 73%) or 2-piece mushroom PK (n = 10, 27%) were included. All patients completed the 6-month follow-up. The mean toric IOL power was 5.3 ± 1.1 D. Both UDVA and CDVA significantly improved (from 1.02 ± 0.27 to 0.46 ± 0.31 logMAR and from 0.65 ± 0.27 to 0.11 ± 0.12 logMAR, respectively; P < .001). 20 eyes (54%) reached UDVA ≥20/40, whereas 35 eyes (95%) reached a CDVA ≥20/40. Final refractive astigmatism was 0.93 ± 0.87 D, with 35 eyes (95%) within 2 D. Prediction error was ≤1 D in 18 eyes (49%). Absolute IOL misalignment was 3.3 ± 3.5 degrees.

The goal of this study is to analyze results for the Carlevale FIL-SSF intraocular lens and propose surgical recommendations.
The P1.5 Collective performed a retrospective analysis, with a minimum follow-up of 6 months, of the records of 72 implantations of the Carlevale FIL-SSF intraocular lens, specifically designed for sutureless scleral fixation in the ciliary sulcus.
The most common indication was exchange of a posterior chamber intraocular lens (70.8%). The surgery lasted a mean of 53.4minutes due to the creation of scleral flaps. The implant was damaged in 12.5% of cases. Visual acuity was improved in 83.3% of cases. The postoperative spherical equivalent was -0.3 diopters, with no change in corneal astigmatism. The implant was centered and stable in all cases. Two cases (2.8%) of cystoid macular edema were observed and resolved over six months.
A number of advantages of the Carlevale FIL-SSF intraocular lens make it a safe and effective solution for correction of aphakia in the absence of capsular support. It requires a longer than usual surgical procedure, and the implant must be handled with care. From their experience, the authors propose 7 recommendations to accelerate the learning curve.

This was a retrospective, non-comparative, clinical interventional study. Patients with hypermature morgagnian cataract who had undergone CTR-assisted phacoemulsification were included in the study. After capsulorhexis, CTR was inserted in a clockwise manner to stabilize the capsular bag in each case. Phacoemulsification was then performed using either horizontal chopping or vertical chopping. We have used the CTR in these cases without any obvious lens subluxation in order to perform safe emulsification of the nuclear pieces in the capsular bag. We have performed the procedure successfully in eleven eyes with hypermature morgagnian cataract.
The mean corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) improved from 2.62 ± 0.25 Log MAR to 0.35 ± 0.28 Log MAR at 3 months postoperatively (P = 0.00008). Total nine out of 11 patients gained CDVA of 20/40 or better at 3 months postoperatively.

The retrospective study included a retrospective analysis of data from 62 patients (91 eyes) who underwent uneventful femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery with Artis PL E (Cristalens Industrie, Lannion, France) IOL implantation by a single surgeon between May 2020 and December 2020 in Severance Hospital, Seoul, South Korea. The new IOLMaster 700 biometry device (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Jena, Germany) was used to calculate TK and K. The mean absolute error (MAE), median absolute error (MedAE), and the percentages of eyes within prediction errors of ± 0.25 D, ± 0.50 D, and ± 1.00 D were calculated for all IOL formulas (SRK/T, Hoffer-Q, Haigis, Holladay 1, Holladay 2, and Barrett Universal II). There was strong agreement between K and TK (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.99), with a mean difference of 0.04 D. For all formulas, MAE tended to be lower for TK than for K, and relatively lower MAE and MedAE values were observed for SRK/T and Holladay 1. Furthermore, for all formulas, a greater proportion of eyes fell within ± 0.25 D of the predicted postoperative spherical equivalent range in the TK group than in the K group. However, differences in MAEs, MedAEs, and percentages of eyes within the above prediction errors were not statistically significant.

163;34138900;Evaluation of postoperative refractive error correction after cataract surgery.;[];PloS one;"Suboptimal cataract surgery outcomes remain a challenge in most developing countries. In Ghana, about 2 million people have been reported to be blind due to cataract with about 20% new cases being recorded yearly. The aim of this study was to evaluate postoperative correction of refractive errors after cataract surgery in a selected eye hospital in Ashanti Region, Ghana. This was a retrospective study where medical records of patients (aged 40-100) who reported to an eye hospital in Ghana from 2013-2018 were reviewed. Included in the study were patients aged ≥40 years and patients with complete records. Data on patient demographics, type of surgery, intra-ocular lens (PCIOL) power, availability of biometry, postoperative refraction outcomes, pre- and postoperative visual acuity were analyzed. Data of two hundred and thirteen eyes of 190 patients who met the inclusion criteria were analyzed. Descriptive analysis and Chi-square test were carried out to determine the mean, median, standard deviation and relevant associations. The mean ± SD age was 67.21±12.2 years (51.2% were females). Small Incision Cataract Surgery (99.5%) with 100% IOL implants was the main cataract surgery procedure in this study. Pre-operative biometry was performed for 38.9% of all patients on their first eye surgery and 41.5% for second eye surgeries. About 71% eyes in this study were blind (presenting VA<3/60) before surgery; 40.4% had post-operative VA <3/60. Pre-existing ocular comorbidities discovered post- surgery, attributed to suboptimal visual outcomes. More than half (55.3%) of patients did not undergo postoperative refraction due to loss to follow-up. Year of surgery (p = .017), follow up visits< 2months (p < .0001) and discovered comorbidity post-surgery (p = .035) were the factors significantly associated with postoperative refraction. Myopia and compound myopic astigmatism were the dominant refractive error outcomes. The timing of post-operative refraction had a significant effect on postoperative refraction done. These findings indicate a clinically meaningful significance between completion of postoperative care and postoperative refraction done. Consequently, with settings in most developing countries, where less biometry is done, it is appropriate that post-operative refractive services are encouraged and done earlier to enhance the patients' expectations while increasing cataract surgery patronage.";;;;;10.1371/journal.pone.0252787;2021-06-18;[{'lastname': 'Antwi-Adjei', 'firstname': 'Ellen Konadu', 'initials': 'EK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Optometry and Visual Science, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana.'}, {'lastname': 'Owusu', 'firstname': 'Emmanuel', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Optometry and Visual Science, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana.'}, {'lastname': 'Kobia-Acquah', 'firstname': 'Emmanuel', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Optometry and Visual Science, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana.'}, {'lastname': 'Dadzie', 'firstname': 'Emmanuella Esi', 'initials': 'EE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Optometry and Visual Science, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana.'}, {'lastname': 'Anarfi', 'firstname': 'Emmanuel', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Optometry and Visual Science, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana.'}, {'lastname': 'Wanye', 'firstname': 'Seth', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Friends Eye Center, Kumasi, Ghana.'}]

Nowadays, several technologies to extend the DoF are available, from corneal laser refractive surgery procedures in presbyopia to intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in cataract or refractive lens exchange. Some of these procedures are based on aspheric profiles, either in the cornea or in the IOL, which modulate the spherical aberration (SA) and, therefore, extend the light energy on different focal planes.

The purpose of this study was to develop a simple calculation scheme for clinicians to predict the object to image magnification in a pseudophakic eye with biometric data.
The calculation scheme for object to image magnification in the pseudophakic eye is based on a vergence calculation of the lens power with theoretical optical formulae. From the biometric data, which are typically derived from both eyes during lens power calculation, the vergences in front of and behind the 3 or 4 refractive surfaces of the pseudophakic eye model are used to predict the magnification for objects at infinity or objects located at a finite measurement distance (e.g. 5 m).
With a formula-based lens power calculation a pseudophakic eye model is set up with 3 or 4 refractive surfaces (postoperative spectacle refraction; thick cornea described by anterior surface or thick cornea characterized by anterior and posterior surfaces; intraocular lens). The vergence in front of and behind each refractive surface is derived by means of linear Gaussian optics. The quotient of the product of all vergences in front of the surfaces and the product of all vergences behind the respective surfaces describes the object to image magnification of the eye. A comparison of the object to image magnification of both eyes yields the retinal image size disparity or aniseikonia. This calculation strategy is shown in a step-by-step approach exemplarily for the Haigis and Hoffer‑Q formulae (3 surfaces) and the Castrop formula (4 surfaces).
If during planning and lens power calculation biometry is performed for both eyes, ocular magnification of both eyes can be easily derived with this calculation scheme and aniseikonia can be extracted from a comparison of magnification of both eyes. Such a simple prediction should be established as a standard for precataract biometry and lens power calculation for early detection and avoidance of asthenopic complaints after cataract surgery.
HINTERGRUND UND ZIELSETZUNG: Die Aniseikonie als mögliche Ursache asthenopischer Beschwerden tritt bei der modernen Kataraktchirurgie oft in den Hintergrund. Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit ist es, dem Kliniker ein einfaches Berechnungsmodell an die Hand zu geben, mit dem der Abbildungsmaßstab des pseudophaken Auges abgeschätzt werden kann.
Das Berechnungsschema für den Abbildungsmaßstab des pseudophaken Auges bezieht sich auf die formelbasierte (vergenzbasierte) Berechnung der Intraokularlinse mit theoretisch-optischen Formeln. Aus den biometrischen Größen, die in der Regel für beide Augen bei der Linsenberechnung vorliegen, kann aus den Vergenzen vor und hinter den 3 oder 4 refraktiven Grenzflächen im pseudophaken Augenmodell der Abbildungsmaßstab für Objekte im Unendlichen oder in einer endlichen Messdistanz ermittelt werden.
Bei der formelbasierten Berechnung wird ein pseudophakes Augenmodell mit 3 bzw. 4 refraktiven Grenzflächen (postoperative Brillenrefraktion; dünne Hornhaut, beschrieben durch die Vorderfläche, bzw. dicke Hornhaut, beschrieben durch die Vorder- und Rückfläche; Intraokularlinse) definiert und mit den Methoden der linearen Optik die Vergenz vor und hinter jeder Grenzfläche bestimmt. Der Quotient aus dem Produkt der Vergenzen vor den Grenzflächen und dem Produkt der Vergenzen unmittelbar hinter den Grenzflächen beschreibt direkt den Abbildungsmaßstab des Auges. Aus dem Vergleich des Abbildungsmaßstabs beider Augen kann unmittelbar der retinale Bildgrößenunterschied ermittelt werden. Exemplarisch wird dies anhand der Haigis- und Hoffer-Q-Formel (3 Flächen) und der Castrop-Formel (4 Flächen) gezeigt.
Wird bei der Planung der Kataraktoperation die Biometrie und Linsenberechnung an beiden Augen durchgeführt, so kann mit einfachen Mitteln der Abbildungsmaßstab bei beiden Augen und aus dem Vergleich beider Augen die Aniseikonie des pseudophaken Patienten ermittelt werden. Eine derartige Abschätzung sollte fester Bestandteil der Linsenberechnung werden, um mögliche asthenopische Beschwerden nach der Kataraktoperation früh zu erkennen.";If during planning and lens power calculation biometry is performed for both eyes, ocular magnification of both eyes can be easily derived with this calculation scheme and aniseikonia can be extracted from a comparison of magnification of both eyes.

Patients with cataract who underwent unilateral phacoemulsification with four types of intraocular lens (IOLs) implantation (Asphina 509M, Tecnis PCB00, enVista MX60, and Acrysof SN60WF) were enrolled. Bilateral AL measurements were performed before and 1 month after cataract surgery utilizing IOLMaster 700. The postoperative AL of the operated eye was evaluated using three different modes (phakic, aphakic, and pseudophakic), and the fellow eye was measured by phakic mode. Associations among the AL change and cataract grade, lens thickness, preoperative AL, or refractive index of IOL were investigated using stepwise multivariate linear regression.
A total of 305 patients with cataract with mean age of 65.97 ± 13.39 years were recruited. The mean postoperative AL was 0.10 mm and 0.21 mm shorter than the pre-operative AL utilizing pseudophakic and phakic modes, respectively (P < 0.001). No significant difference was observed between pre-operative and postoperative AL using aphakic mode (P = 0.264).

183;34029241;Long-Term Results and Refractive Error After Cataract Surgery With a Scleral Incision in Eyes With Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty.;[];Cornea;"Phacoemulsification in eyes with deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) is associated with possible decreased graft survival and difficult IOL power calculation. We assessed cataract surgery in eyes with previous DALK.
Thirty-three consecutive eyes with DALK and further phacoemulsification with scleral incision were included in this retrospective study. At each postoperative visit, eyes were assessed with manifest refraction, optical coherence tomography, specular corneal topography, and noncontact wide-field specular microscopy.
The average postkeratoplasty follow-up time was 102 months [95%-CI, (85-119)]. Cataract surgery was performed on average 43 months (30-56) after DALK. The average postphacoemulsification follow-up time was 58 months [42-74]. All grafts remained clear during follow-up. The best spectacle-corrected logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution visual acuity improved by 2.5 lines [1.8-3.1] on average after cataract surgery from 0.58 (20/77) to 0.34 (20/44) (P < 0.001). The spherical equivalent and intraocular pressure significantly improved from -4.1 D to -1.7 D and from 15.9 to 14.0 mm Hg, respectively. The corneal central thickness was not significantly modified, and the endothelial density decreased by 5.3% from 2081 to 1970 cells/mm2 (P = 0.003). The minimal difference between the achieved and predicted spherical equivalents [-0.05 D, (-2.33; +2.21)] was obtained with the Hoffer Q formula using the IOLMaster axial length and the Orbscan keratometry.
Patients with DALK who underwent phacoemulsification with a scleral incision had a satisfying residual refractive error, very high graft survival, and very few complications.

There are well-documented advantages in terms of quicker visual rehabilitation and reduced costs. The risk of bilateral simultaneous endophthalmitis and bilateral blindness is now recognized to be minuscule with the advent of intracameral antibiotics and modern management of endophthalmitis. Refractive surprises are rare for normal eyes and with the use of optical biometry. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, all elective surgeries were stopped. This has resulted in a large backlog of deferred cataract surgeries. Now more than ever before, we should consider ISBCS as an excellent alternative to delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery in the right hospital or surgical setting. In the age of COVID-19, it can help to decrease surgical scheduling and follow-up visits. The one change in practice that could have the most significant benefit in reducing infection exposure risk is ISBCS.;;;;;10.4103/ijo.IJO_3586_20;2021-05-21;[{'lastname': 'Bhalla', 'firstname': 'Jatinder S', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, Hari Nagar, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Zakai', 'firstname': 'Mohmad Uzair', 'initials': 'MU', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, Hari Nagar, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Mehtani', 'firstname': 'Amit', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, Hari Nagar, New Delhi, India.'}]

This was a pilot retrospective cohort study of all ISBCS and DSBCS patients who underwent senior resident-performed cataract surgery from May to September 2020 at a single academic institution. Outcome measures were final corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), final manifest refraction (MRx), intraoperative and postoperative complications rates, total number of visits, and patient satisfaction assessed postoperatively by telephone questionnaire.
Twenty-two eyes of 14 patients and 56 eyes of 28 patients underwent senior resident-performed ISBCS and DSBCS, respectively. Final CDVA was 20/25 or better in 21 (95%) ISBCS and 51 (91%) DSBCS eyes (P = 0.670). Deviation of final MRx from target refraction was within 0.50 D in 17 (77%) ISBCS and 47 (84%) DSBCS eyes (P = 0.522). There was no significant difference in intraoperative (P = 1.000) or postoperative (P = 1.000) complications. ISBCS patients averaged 3.5 fewer visits than DSBCS patients (5.9 vs 9.5, P < 0.001). All ISBCS and 20 DSBCS patients (87%) reported they were ""very satisfied"" or ""satisfied"" with their experience (P = 0.701). Five of six senior residents responded that they preferred performing ISBCS over DSBCS.
This early experience suggests that senior resident-performed ISBCS is as safe and effective as DSBCS, with the added benefit of averaging fewer in-person visits.

In this retrospective study, we evaluated patients who underwent pars plans vitrectomy with ACIOL implantation from April 2016 to March 2019. Patients with minimum follow-up period of 1 year and operated by single surgeon were included. Ophthalmic history, indication for surgery, BCVA, IOP, slit-lamp examination, and fundus assessment findings were noted. Postoperatively best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP) and complications if any were noted.
Ninety eyes of 88 patients were included in the study. The mean age of the patients was 60.2 ± 10.2 yrs. Majority (75.6%) were males and 24.4% were females. Indications for pars-plana vitrectomy (PPV) with ACIOL implantation were nucleus drop in 16.6%, IOL drop in 25.5%, large posterior capsular rupture (PCR) with vitreous disturbance or zonular dehiscence (ZD) during cataract surgery in 33.3%, more than 180° subluxation of lens in 10% and traumatic lens or intraocular lens (IOL) drop in 14.4% cases.

The purposes of this study are to report a case of late-onset capsular block syndrome or lacteocrumenasia and to describe differential diagnosis with other more common phacoemulsification complications such as intraocular lens (IOL) or posterior capsule opacification.
We report the case of a 56-year-old man with a clinical history of cataract surgery in his left eye. Five years after cataract surgery, he complained of blurred vision and was referred for IOL removal to our hospital. After careful slit-lamp examination, we found that the lens was clear, and opacity belonged to the accumulation of a whitish material in the capsular bag behind the lens. AS-OCT gave the definite diagnosis of capsular block syndrome. Intraocular lens removal had been wrongly indicated, and we treated our patient by YAG laser posterior capsulotomy. AS-OCT confirmed the absence of a further accumulated material, so no other interventions were needed. After treatment, best-corrected visual acuity improved from 0.48 to 0.1 logMAR.
Capsular block syndrome is a rare late-onset complication of cataract surgery causing a deep visual acuity decay. A precise slit-lamp examination and AS-OCT, together, avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary surgical treatment, which may be needed in case of IOL opacity or fibrotic-like lacteocrumenasia. AS-OCT also helps in determining the treatment outcome.

Since 2013, 50 eyes in 30 patients <12 years (20 bilateral and 10 unilateral) have been operated at our department with the BIL technique, with a median follow-up time of 33.5 months (range 6-77). Median age at surgery was 49.5 months (4-139). In one case, the IOL luxated through the capsulorhexes to the vitreous, but could be secured and repositioned as planned without further difficulties. Anterior vitrectomy was necessary in one case due to prolapse of vitreous to the anterior chamber during surgery. No other intraoperative complications occurred. Visual axis opacification (VAO) developed in four eyes (8%). So far, only one of these has needed a reoperation with clearing of the secondary cataract. A complete absence of VAO was thus seen throughout the study period in 92%. In two eyes, postoperative iris capture occurred. In both cases, surgical repositioning of the iris was needed.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the intra-operative outcomes achieved with high and low pulse energy femtosecond laser systems for cataract surgery. The charts of 200 eyes of 200 patients aged 68.3 ± 10.3 years who had undergone femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery using either group 1 high pulse energy: LenSx (Alcon Laboratories) (N = 100) or group 2 low pulse energy: FEMTO LDV Z8 (Ziemer) (N = 100) laser were reviewed retrospectively. Integrity of anterior capsulotomy, classified as (1) complete (free-floating or with minor microadhesions), (2) incomplete and (3) with capsular tears, intraoperative completeness of the clear corneal incisions (CCI, main incision and side port), incidences of intraoperative miosis and incidence of subconjunctival hemorrhage were evaluated and compared between the two groups. The proportion of complete capsulotomies was significantly higher in the group 2 than the group 1 (100% vs 94%; p = 0.03). The incidences of intraoperative miosis (0% vs 19%) and subconjunctival hemorrhage (1% vs 63%) were significantly lower in the group 2 than the group 1 (p < 0.001).

200;33927353;Recurring themes during cataract assessment and surgery.;[];Eye (London, England);"The aim of this review was to discuss frequently encountered themes such as cataract surgery in presence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), dementia, Immediate Sequential Bilateral Cataract Surgery (ISBCS), discussing non-standard intraocular lens (IOL) options during consultation in the National Health Services (NHS) and the choice of the biometric formulae based on axial length. Individual groups of authors worked independently on each topic. We found that cataract surgery does improve visual acuity in AMD patients but the need for cataract surgery should be individualised. In patients with dementia, cataract surgery should be considered 'sooner rather than later' as progression may prevent individuals presenting for surgery. This should be planned after discussion of patients' best interests with any carers; multifocal IOLs are not proven to be the best option in these patients. ISBCS gives comparable outcomes to delayed sequential surgeries with a low risk of bilateral endophthalmitis and it can be cost-saving and efficient. Patients are entitled to know all suitable IOL options that can improve their quality of life. Deliberately withholding this information or pressuring patients to choose a non-standard IOL is inappropriate. However, one should be mindful of the not spending inappropriate amounts of time discussing these in the NHS setting which may affect care of other NHS patients. Evidence suggests Hoffer Q, Haigis, Hill-RBF and Kane formulae for shorter eyes; Barrett Universal II (BU II), Holladay II, Haigis and Kane formulae for longer eyes and BU II, Hill-RBF and Kane formulae for medium axial length eyes.
摘要: 本文旨在探讨在合并年龄相关性黄斑变性 (age-related macular degeneration, AMD)、 痴呆进行白内障手术以及即刻连续性双侧白内障手术(Immediate Sequential Bilateral Cataract Surgery, ISBCS)时存在的一些问题, 讨论在国家医疗服务制度 (National Health Services, NHS) 和基于生物轴向长度公式计算眼内人工晶体的选择。每组作者针对每个话题进行独立工作。我们发现, 白内障手术确实能提高AMD患者的视力, 但是否需要行白内障手术应因人而异。对于痴呆患者, 白内障手术应该被认为“更早而不是晚”, 因为病情进展可能会妨碍患者接受手术。这应在与医疗人员讨论病人的最大利益后进行安排和计划;尚未证明多焦IOLs是这些患者的最佳选择。与延迟连续手术相比, ISBCS双侧眼内炎的风险较低, 并且其成本更低及高效。患者有权获知所有可以改善其生活质量的合适的IOL选择方面的信息, 故意隐瞒这些信息或强迫患者选择非标准IOL是不妥的。然而, 在NHS系统中人们应该注意不要花过多的时间讨论这些, 因为这可能会影响NHS其他患者的护理。证据表明Hoffer Q、Haigis、Hill-RBF和Kane公式适用于眼轴较短的眼;较长眼轴的眼使用Barrett Universal II (BU II)、Holladay II、Haigis和Kane公式, 中等眼轴的眼使用BU II、Hill-RBF和Kane公式。.";;;;© 2021.

The patient with the diagnosis of familial ectopia lentis was first operated on for crystalline lens subluxation in the left eye in 2007 and in the right eye in 2009. In both eyes, lens extraction with anterior vitrectomy and transscleral fixation of a rigid IOL was performed. In 2011, the IOL in the right eye luxated into the vitreous cavity due to ocular trauma. The patient underwent a pars plana vitrectomy with the IOL resuturation to the sclera. Seven years later, a spontaneous vision loss in the right eye was caused by a retinal detachment. The pars plana vitrectomy with silicone oil tamponade and a consequential oil removal three months later were performed in 2018. The follow-up examination revealed recurrent IOL dislocation in the same eye. Due to a history of previous suture-related complications a decision was made to remove the subluxated rigid polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA) IOL and fixate to sclera a sutureless SOLEKO FIL SSF Carlevale lens. The purpose of this report is to present a single case of a 36-year-old patient who was presented to the hospital with recurrent dislocation of the intraocular lens. In a three-month follow-up period, a good anatomical and functional outcome was finally obtained with transscleral sutureless intraocular lens.

All eyes achieved satisfactory anatomic result with round pupil diameter 3.5-4.5 mm. Glare and photophobia disappeared in all patients. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. During the follow-up period, pupils remained round and iris-claw lenses well positioned, without tilting. Combined iris cerclage pupilloplasty with retropupillar iris claw lens implantation appears to be a safe and effective surgical technique in reducing pupil size and improving visual outcomes.

The software system guides the surgeon toward a hypothetical shape of the cornea. When this shape is achieved, the vertical meridian is relaxed and the incision does not produce any astigmatism. How that hypothetical shape is to be achieved by the surgeon is described. If preoperative astigmatism exists, the hypothetical shape calculated by the system takes that into account. This enables the surgeon to reduce preexisting astigmatism, without having to change the site or size of the standard 6 mm 12 o clock incision of SICS. Results: Results indicated that preoperative astigmatism reduced in 11 out of 14 cases at the end of 8 weeks, remained unchanged in one, and increased by less than 0.5D in two cases. This proves the hypothesis that the vertical corneal meridian is under higher tension and relaxing it by flattening the perpendicular meridian has a reducing effect on postoperative astigmatism.;;;;;10.4103/ijo.IJO_2954_20;2021-04-30;"[{'lastname': 'Raut', 'firstname': 'Rajeev M', 'initials': 'RM', 'affiliation': 'Life Sciences Research Trust; Jehangir Hospital Pune, 32, Sasoon Road Opposite Railway Station, Central Excise Colony, Sangamvadi, Pune, Maharashtra, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Jeswani', 'firstname': 'Kumud D', 'initials': 'KD', 'affiliation': 'Life Sciences Research Trust, Sangamvadi, Pune, Maharashtra, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Raut', 'firstname': 'Madhuri R', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': 'Life Sciences Research Trust, Sangamvadi, Pune, Maharashtra, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Raut', 'firstname': 'Bhargav R', 'initials': 'BR', 'affiliation': 'Life Sciences Research Trust, Sangamvadi, Pune, Maharashtra, India.'}]"

Opacities in the IOL material are increasingly described in the literature as a reason for IOL explantation. This paper provides an overview of the different forms of IOL material opacities. Currently relevant forms of IOL material opacities and their effects on optical quality are summarized. The main reason for opacification in hydrophilic IOLs is calcification, whereas in hydrophobic IOLs it is mainly the formation of so-called glistenings that is reported. Most material opacities affect various optical parameters and lead to increased intraocular straylight. In case of a disturbing material opacification, the only therapeutic option is to replace the opacified IOL.

219;33865952;Intraocular lenses as drug delivery devices.;['Cataracts surgery', 'Drug delivery', 'Endophthalmitis', 'Intraocular lenses', 'Ocular inflammation', 'Posterior capsule opacification'];International journal of pharmaceutics;Cataract surgery is one of the most common and safe surgical procedures nowadays. However, it is not free of risks as endophthalmitis, ocular inflammation and posterior capsule opacification (PCO) can appear as post-surgery complications. The usual eye drop therapy used as prophylaxis for the former two complications has limited bioavailability. In turn, the prevention of PCO involves an adequate surgical technique and a careful choice of intraocular lens (IOL) design and material. Also, different drugs have been tested to reduce incidence of PCO, but no prophylaxis demonstrated to be completely effective. In the past few years, IOLs have been proposed as drug delivery devices to replace or/assist the usual eye drop therapy in the post-operatory period. The great advantage of drug loaded IOLs would be to ensure a continuous drug delivery, independent of patient's compliance without requiring any further action besides IOL implantation. The biggest challenge of drug loaded IOLs production is to achieve a controlled and extended release that meet therapeutic needs without inducing toxicity to the surrounding ocular tissues or affecting the physical properties of the lens. This review starts by addressing the possible complications after cataract surgery, as well as the most commonly adopted prophylaxis for each of them. The various types of IOLs are described and their main advantages/disadvantages are discussed. The different strategies pursued to incorporate drugs into the IOLs and control their release, which include soaking the IOL in the drugs solution, supercritical impregnation, surface modifications, and attachment of drug reservoirs to the IOL, among others, are reported. For each strategy, a summary of the publications is presented, which includes the target complication, the types and amounts of released drugs and the IOL materials. A brief description of each individual study is given afterwards. Optimization of drug loaded IOLs through mathematical modelling and possible issues raised by their sterilization are also tackled. At the end, the future commercialization of drug loaded IOLs is commented.;;;;Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Cataract surgery is the most frequently performed surgical procedure in the world. The increase in IOL designs has not been paralleled in practice by a sophistication in IOL selection methods, which rely on limited anatomical measurements of the eye and the surgeon's interpretation of the patient's needs and expectations. We propose that the future of IOL selection will be guided by 3D quantitative imaging of the crystalline lens to map lens opacities, anticipate IOL position, and develop fully customized eye models for ray-tracing-based IOL selection. Conversely, visual simulators (in which IOL designs are programmed in active elements) allow patients to experience prospective vision before surgery and to make more informed decisions about which IOL to choose. Quantitative imaging and optical and visual simulations of postsurgery outcomes will allow optimal treatments to be selected for a patient undergoing modern cataract surgery.;;;;;10.1146/annurev-bioeng-082420-035827;2021-04-14;"[{'lastname': 'Marcos', 'firstname': 'Susana', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Instituto de Óptica ""Daza de Valdés,"" Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (IO-CSIC), Madrid 28006, Spain; email: susana@io.cfmac.csic.es.'}, {'lastname': 'Martinez-Enriquez', 'firstname': 'Eduardo', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Instituto de Óptica ""Daza de Valdés,"" Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (IO-CSIC), Madrid 28006, Spain; email: susana@io.cfmac.csic.es.'}, {'lastname': 'Vinas', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Instituto de Óptica ""Daza de Valdés,"" Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (IO-CSIC), Madrid 28006, Spain; email: susana@io.cfmac.csic.es.'}, {'lastname': 'de Castro', 'firstname': 'Alberto', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Instituto de Óptica ""Daza de Valdés,"" Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (IO-CSIC), Madrid 28006, Spain; email: susana@io.cfmac.csic.es.'}, {'lastname': 'Dorronsoro', 'firstname': 'Carlos', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Instituto de Óptica ""Daza de Valdés,"" Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (IO-CSIC), Madrid 28006, Spain; email: susana@io.cfmac.csic.es.\n2EyesVision, Madrid 28760, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Bang', 'firstname': 'Seung Pil', 'initials': 'SP', 'affiliation': 'Flaum Eye Institute, The Institute of Optics, Center for Visual Science, Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York 14632, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Yoon', 'firstname': 'Geunyoung', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Flaum Eye Institute, The Institute of Optics, Center for Visual Science, Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York 14632, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Artal', 'firstname': 'Pablo', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Laboratorio de Óptica, Universidad de Murcia, Murcia 30100, Spain.'}]"
222;33835929;Computer-Aided Intraoperative Toric Intraocular Lens Positioning and Alignment During Cataract Surgery.;[];IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics;Cataract causes more than half of all blindness worldwide. The most effective treatment is surgery, where cataract is often replaced by intraocular lens (IOL). Beyond saving vision, toric IOL implantation is becoming increasingly popular to correct corneal astigmatism. It is important to precisely position and align the axis of IOL during surgery to achieve optimal post-operative astigmatism correction. Comparing with conventional manual marking, automated markerless IOL alignment can be faster, more accurate and non-invasive. Here we propose a framework for computer-assisted intraoperative IOL positioning and alignment based on detection and tracking. Firstly, the iris boundary was segmented and the eye center was determined. A statistical sampling method was developed to segment iris and generate training labels, and both conventional algorithms and deep convolutional neural network (CNN) methods were evaluated. Then, regions of interests (ROIs) containing high density of scleral capillaries were used for tracking eye rotations. Both correlation filter and CNN methods were evaluated for tracking. Cumulative errors during long-term tracking were corrected using a reference image. Validation studies against manual labeling using 7 clinical cataract surgical videos demonstrated that the proposed algorithm achieved an average position error around 0.2 mm, an axis alignment error of < 1 ;;;;;10.1109/JBHI.2021.3072246;2021-04-10;[{'lastname': 'Zhai', 'firstname': 'Yuxuan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Guanghua', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zheng', 'firstname': 'Longsheng', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Guangqian', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zhao', 'firstname': 'Ke', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gong', 'firstname': 'Yubin', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Zhe', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Ximei', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sun', 'firstname': 'Bin', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Zhao', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': None}]

Two surgical approaches are proposed: implantation by suture-loaded cartridge and ""open sky"" implantation combined with penetrating keratoplasty. The method of establishing the exact position of the scleral fixation points and the pre-assembly of the suture of Reper before its implantation are the main novel proposed surgical procedures. The rationale is to minimize surgical procedures in the anterior chamber and to prevent knot loosening and lens tilting. The simultaneous treatment of aphakia and aniridia with a single prosthesis, the stability of the Reper and the functional, anatomical and aesthetic outcomes obtained are the highlighted advantages in this study.";;;;;10.1177/11206721211005693;2021-03-30;[{'lastname': 'Frisina', 'firstname': 'Rino', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology of University of Padova, Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'De Biasi', 'firstname': 'Chiara Sofia', 'initials': 'CS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology of University of Padova, Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Tozzi', 'firstname': 'Luigi', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology of University of Padova, Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Gius', 'firstname': 'Irene', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology of University of Padova, Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Londei', 'firstname': 'Davide', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology of University of Padova, Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Gambato', 'firstname': 'Catia', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology of University of Padova, Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Midena', 'firstname': 'Edoardo', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology of University of Padova, Padova, Italy.'}]

The results of this study indicate that a three-piece foldable IOL implantation with POBH is a feasible option for children who experienced ACE during pediatric cataract surgery, as it results in satisfactory surgical outcomes and very few ocular complications.;;;;;10.4103/ijo.IJO_1622_20;2021-03-18;[{'lastname': 'Mohan', 'firstname': 'Amit', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus, Children Eye Care Center, Sadguru Netra Chikitsalya and Postgraduate Institute of Ophthalmology, Jankikund Chitrakoot, Madhya Pradesh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Sen', 'firstname': 'Pradhnya', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus, Children Eye Care Center, Sadguru Netra Chikitsalya and Postgraduate Institute of Ophthalmology, Jankikund Chitrakoot, Madhya Pradesh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Jain', 'firstname': 'Richa', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus, Children Eye Care Center, Sadguru Netra Chikitsalya and Postgraduate Institute of Ophthalmology, Jankikund Chitrakoot, Madhya Pradesh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Shah', 'firstname': 'Chintan', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus, Children Eye Care Center, Sadguru Netra Chikitsalya and Postgraduate Institute of Ophthalmology, Jankikund Chitrakoot, Madhya Pradesh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Jain', 'firstname': 'Elesh', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus, Children Eye Care Center, Sadguru Netra Chikitsalya and Postgraduate Institute of Ophthalmology, Jankikund Chitrakoot, Madhya Pradesh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Sen', 'firstname': 'Alok', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus, Children Eye Care Center, Sadguru Netra Chikitsalya and Postgraduate Institute of Ophthalmology, Jankikund Chitrakoot, Madhya Pradesh, India.'}]
237;33725870;Repeated rotation of a toric implantable collamer lens: A case report.;[];Medicine;"Implantable collamer lens have been used widely worldwide, and have been accepted by more and more doctors and patients due to good safety, stability, and effectiveness. However, there is still a problem of crystal rotation. The large angle rotation (over 10°) would weaken the original astigmatism correction effect and even induce irregular astigmatism, seriously affecting the visual quality of patients. Herein, we reported a case who had 2 times of crystal rotations after toric implantable collamer lens (TICL) implantation.
The patient was a 38-year-old man who underwent TICL implantation for the correction of high myopic astigmatism in eyes. He presented a sudden decrease in the visual acuity (VA) of the left eye 4 months after the TICL implantation. The uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) was 8/20 (refraction, +2.25 -5.25 × 68).
Rotation of TICL was diagnosed. The toric marks with a rotation of 75° counter-clockwise from the original position were observed.
The TICL was re-set to the original position, leading to the UCVA of 12/20 in the left eye (refraction, -0.00 -0.75 × 131), with the vaulting of 589 μm. Ten months after the TICL relocation, the patient again presented a sudden decrease in the VA of the left eye, with the UCVA of 2/20 (refraction, +2.25 -5.00 × 66). Again, the toric marks with a rotation of 75° counter-clockwise from the original position was observed, just at the same position as the last rotation. This time, the TICL was removed. The axis and power were recalculated, and a new TICL was implanted, with the rotation of 73° counter-clockwise from the horizontal line of the temporal side.
The patient obtained a final UCVA of 12/20 in the left eye (refraction, +0.50 -0.50 × 26), which remained stable in the 6-month follow-up period, with the vaulting of 602 μm.
Rotation is a common complication after TICL surgery. Relocation or replacement of TICL are safe and efficient ways to recover VA due to TICL rotation.";;;;Copyright © 2021 the Author(s).

239;33720958;The effect of capsule tension ring on posterior capsule opacification: A meta-analysis.;[];PloS one;"Posterior capsule opacification is one of the most common complications after cataract surgery. Studies have suggested that the introduction of a capsule tension ring might play a critical role in the prevention of capsule opacification, yet quantitative evidence is still lacking. This work consists of a meta-analysis on available data in order to explore the influence of a capsule tension ring on posterior capsule opacification.
A comprehensive review of the literature on capsule tension ring and posterior capsule opacification was carried out using the Embase, Pubmed, Web of Science, and Cochrane electronic databases. The selected studies included randomized controlled trials, retrospective studies and prospective studies published before June 2020. The studies of interest were selected by two reviewers independently from the included studies. Odds ratios (ORs) and standardized mean differences (SMD) were used in order to assess the association. A fixed-effects model or a random-effects model was applied to combine data according to heterogeneities. Sensitivity analysis was used to assess the heterogeneity of the studies. Publication bias was estimated using the Egger test. Statistical analysis was performed using the stata15.1 software.
The meta-analysis included in total 8 studies involving 379 cases and 333 controls. There was a statistically significant difference of Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy rate (OR=0.241, 95% CI: 0.145, 0.400 I2=42.1%) between the capsule tension ring group and the control group, indicating that the tension ring reduced the Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy rate. Further studies with continuous data also revealed that the use of capsule tension ring was associated with a lower posterior capsule opacification score (SMD = -1.402, 95% CI: -2.448, -0.355 I2=95.0%). The sensitivity analysis suggested that the result of the re-combined analysis did not change notably, indicating that the result was reliable and stable. Both pooled analysis showed no evidence of publication bias.

A prospective, single-center, open label, randomized, two-arm study was designed. Cataract patients with corneal astigmatism of 1.0-2.0D were enrolled and divided into test and control groups. The test group had the AcrySof® IQ Toric IOL implanted and the control group had the AcrySof® IQ IOL implanted with a steep-axis corneal incision. All patients underwent examinations of uncorrected distance visual acuity (UCDVA), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), subjective refraction, and corneal astigmatism before surgery and at the 1-day, 1-month, and 3-month follow-ups. Vector astigmatism analysis was evaluated using the Alpins method.
We enrolled 26 eyes of 20 patients in the study, with 13 eyes in each group. The test group had better vision than the control group at the 3-month follow-up and had more cases with a UCDVA of 20/20 (10/13 vs. 4/13). The surgically induced astigmatism (SIA) vector of the test group was higher than that of the control group (1.22±0.64 vs. 0.84±0.45).

The iris-claw lens has two haptics with fine fissures for folding (enclavating) the mid-peripheral part of the iris stroma and can either be placed in front of or posterior to the iris. In particular, the retropupillary implantation has been increasingly chosen probably due to having an anatomical position similar to that of the crystalline lens. The present review is based on a literature review and also on the authors' clinical experience with this lens, and it focuses on surgical techniques and outcomes especially related to the characteristics of this lens, having haptics with claws that fixate the lens to the posterior iris. Implanting retropupillary iris-claw lenses has a relatively short learning curve, and there are only few complications reported during surgery. Retropupillary iris-claw lenses have demonstrated generally favourable efficiency and safety. However, the outcomes are probably more influenced by the reason for surgery and eye comorbidity than the lens itself. Albeit seldom reported, the postoperative complications have mostly been related to atrophy of the iris at the site of the haptics, or IOL decentration or disenclavation of one of the haptics. To date, however, there are few randomized clinical trials comparing this lens to other lens alternatives in eyes exhibiting insufficient capsular or zonular support for placing the lens in the ciliary sulcus. In the future, prospective studies with large samples should be performed to gain insights into the long-term safety of retropupillary placed iris-claw lenses, and for comparisons with the various other techniques of lens fixation.;;;;© 2021 The Authors.

A questionnaire conducted using SurveyMonkey was used to evaluate the answers to 17 questions from 823 members of the Turkish Ophthalmological Association. Results were evaluated in subgroups according to the participants' age, occupational status, institutions, and whether they conducted relevant academic activities, and the data were compared as inadequate, standard, and contemporary approaches according to the determined criteria.
Optical biometry devices were used at rates of 77.7% and 67.3% for intraocular lens (IOL) power calculations and keratometric measurements in preparation for cataract surgery, respectively. For IOL power calculation, third-generation formulas, especially the SRK-T, were used most commonly (46.2%), followed by second-generation formulas (21.9%), and fourth/fifth-generation formulas and multiple evaluations for different axial lengths (31.9%). The most common incision size was 2.8 mm (51.6%), while the percentage of 2.2 mm and shorter incisions considered to be neutral in terms of surgically induced astigmatism was 18.8%. When selecting incision location, approaches to reduce corneal astigmatism were reported by 28.9%, neutral approaches by 26.2%, and insensitive approaches by 44.9%. Additionally, 55.6% of participants never implanted toric IOLs and 50.7% did not use presbyopia-correcting IOLs. The proportion of surgeons who have experience with femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery was 10.3% and the rate of intracameral antibiotic injection at the end of the operation was 89.4%.
It was seen that Turkish cataract surgeons were able to use high technology for surgical preparation and surgery at high rates, but this was not reflected in practice at same rate in terms of achieving contemporary standards of refractive cataract surgery.";;;;;10.4274/tjo.galenos.2020.46020;2021-02-27;[{'lastname': 'Can', 'firstname': 'İzzet', 'initials': 'İ', 'affiliation': 'Private Practice, Ankara, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Takmaz', 'firstname': 'Tamer', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Ankara City Hospital, Clinic of Ophthalmology, Ankara, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Özdamar', 'firstname': 'Akif', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'İstanbul University-Cerrahpaşa, Cerrahpaşa Faculty of Medicine, Department of Ophthalmology, İstanbul, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Kamış', 'firstname': 'Ümit', 'initials': 'Ü', 'affiliation': 'Konya Dünyagöz Hospital, Konya, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Aydın Akova', 'firstname': 'Yonca', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Bayındır Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Arslan', 'firstname': 'Osman Şevki', 'initials': 'OŞ', 'affiliation': 'İstanbul University-Cerrahpaşa, Cerrahpaşa Faculty of Medicine, Department of Ophthalmology, İstanbul, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Baykara', 'firstname': 'Mehmet', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Uludağ University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Ophthalmology, Bursa, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Devranoğlu', 'firstname': 'Kazım', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Private Practice, İstanbul, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Günenç', 'firstname': 'Üzeyir', 'initials': 'Ü', 'affiliation': 'Dokuz Eylül University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Ophthalmology, İzmir, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Mutlu', 'firstname': 'Fatih Mehmet', 'initials': 'FM', 'affiliation': 'University of Health Sciences, Gülhane Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Özcan', 'firstname': 'Altan Atakan', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Çukurova University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Ophthalmology, Adana, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Taşındı', 'firstname': 'Emrullah', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Okan University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Ophthalmology, İstanbul, Turkey.'}]

One eye of the patients who were followed up for at least 1 year was included in the study. The two groups were compared in terms of indications, corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), refractive results, complications, and graft survival.
In the CS and SS groups, the median age was 63 (30-79) and 43 (18-73) years (p<0.001) and the median follow-up time was 51 (13-152) and 64.5 (13-154) months (p=0.011), respectively.

Daily for 2 weeks and weekly thereafter, patients recovering from trabeculectomy, tube shunt implantation, or cataract extraction (CE) completed a diary-style questionnaire including visual analog scales (VASs; scored 0-100) grading pain and global function. Clinical examination data and medical histories were collected. Generalized estimating equation models evaluated associations between VAS function scores and pain or visual acuity (VA) and compared scores between surgery types.
Among 51 participants followed for 12 weeks, tube shunt placement reduced postoperative day 1 (POD1) function by 47 of 100 points vs CE (P = .006), while trabeculectomy did not reduce POD1 function vs CE (P = .33). After CE, trabeculectomy, and tube shunt placement, average VAS function scores increased 13.94 per week for 2 weeks (P < .001), 4.18 per week for 4 weeks (P = .02), and 7.76 per week for 7 weeks (P < .001), respectively. After those timepoints, there was no further significant change. Beyond 2 weeks, pain levels plateaued, and VA returned to baseline across surgery types; function was inversely related to pain or VA only for the first 2 or 4 weeks, respectively.

Important preoperative factors related to poor visual prognosis were morphology of cataract (P = 0.004), microphthalmos (P < 0.001), features suggestive of iris hypoplasia (P < 0.001), optic atrophy (P < 0.001), nystagmus (P = 0.02), and associated neurological anomalies (P = 0.0023). We found no significant statistical association between postoperative visual outcome and isolated rubella retinopathy, cloudy cornea, cardiological, and ontological abnormalities.
Cataract associated with rubella is a common cause of congenital cataract in developing countries. Determining prognostic factors helps us in parent counseling and planning treatment protocols. Nevertheless, early detection and treatment with adequate multidisciplinary approach remains priority for improving long-term visual outcomes.";;;;;10.4103/ijo.IJO_903_20;2021-02-18;[{'lastname': 'Joshi', 'firstname': 'Deepti', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus, M M Joshi Eye Institute, Hubli, Karnataka, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Krishnaprasad', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus, M M Joshi Eye Institute, Hubli, Karnataka, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Agrawal', 'firstname': 'Apeksha', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus, M M Joshi Eye Institute, Hubli, Karnataka, India.'}]

A total of 12 eyes of 12 patients with clinically confirmed posterior polar cataract, who underwent cataract surgery by a single surgeon under the direct guidance of iOCT. The changes along nucleo-epinuclear junction and opacity-capsular junction during/following hydrodelineation and the changes along the opacity-capsular junction following nucleus removal, capsular changes before the opacity removal, and its dynamic changes throughout the surgical procedure were studied.
The mean age of patients was 48.25 ± 7.89 years. Eight of them were males and the right eye was operated in seven patients. With regular hydrodelineation, optimal separation of the nucleus-epinuclear layer was evident in 11 patients. Once a golden ring is achieved through the hydro procedure, then repeated attempts can be performed within it to decrease the chances of capsular damage. Fracture of the posterior opacity with tension over the underlying capsule (n = 1), inadvertent hydro dissection while performing hydrodelineation (n = 1), continuous posterior capsular billowing (n = 2), and posterior capsular ruptures (n = 2) were encountered in this observation with even well-judged surgical maneuvering.
iOCT provides a better understanding of real-time changes along different layers of the human lens during posterior polar cataract surgery.

256;33594017;Towards Vision 2020 -Trends of Cataract Surgery in Melaka Hospital, A Malaysian Tertiary Center: 2007-2014.;[];Kathmandu University medical journal (KUMJ);Background Cataract surgery which is the only scientific method to treat cataracts has evolved from large incisions of intracapsular cataract excision to extracapsular cataract exicison and now modern day phacoemulsification. Anaesthesia too has progressed from general anaesthesia to local and topical anaesthesia. A variety of intraocular lenses are available ranging from rigid to foldable, multifocal and toric. Day care surgeries are becoming the norm these days. Objective Cataract surgery has advanced with new techniques and modalities. We studied the trends of cataract surgery and outcomes over the years. Method We performed secondary data analysis (National Eye Database) of cataract surgery patients in Hospital Melaka (2007 - 2014). Result Most patients were 60-69 years (mean 65.0 years). Primary cataract rose (p<0.05) but there was no difference in laterality and first or second eye (p>0.05). More patients presented with Hypertension and Diabetes (p<0.05). Pterygium encroaching the cornea showed a rise (p<0.05). Phacoemulsification (80.8%) showed a rise while Extracapsular Cataract Extraction (ECCE) (15.4%) declined (p<0.05). More Specialists operated and fewer combined surgeries were performed (p<0.001). Type of anaesthesia did not change (p>0.05). Operative complications reduced (p<0.001). Anterior chamber, scleral fixated and foldable intraocular lenses usage reduced (p<0.05). There was no change in pre-operative visual acuity (p>0.05) but postoperative vision showed a rise in good outcomes (p<0.05). Conclusion Melaka Hospital shows a rise in phacoemulsification and a decline in Extracapsular Cataract Extraction. More patients presented with primary cataracts. More Specialists operated and there was a reduction in intraoperative and postoperative complications. Post-operative visual outcomes showed a remarkable improvement. This improvement is in keeping with the aim of improved vision for all by 2020.;;;;;;2021-02-18;[{'lastname': 'Thevi', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Hospital Melaka, Jalan Mufti Haji Khalil, 75400 Melaka, Malaysia.'}, {'lastname': 'Abas', 'firstname': 'A L', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': 'Melaka Manipal Medical College, Jalan Batu Hampa, 75400 Melaka, Malaysia.'}]

260;33571531;Assessment of intraocular lens/capsular bag biomechanical interactions following cataract surgery in a human in vitro graded culture capsular bag model.;['Capsular bag', 'Cataract surgery', 'Human', 'In vitro', 'Intraocular lens', 'Lens', 'Model', 'Posterior capsule opacification'];Experimental eye research;"Intraocular lenses (IOLs) are implanted during cataract surgery. For optimum results, stable positioning of the IOL in the capsular bag is important. Wound-healing events following cataract surgery lead to modification of the capsular bag and secondary visual loss due to posterior capsule opacification. At present, it is unclear how these biological events can affect stability of the IOL within the capsular bag. In the present study, a human in vitro graded culture capsular bag model was the experimental system. Capsulorhexis and lens extraction performed on human donor eyes generated suspended capsular bags (5 match-paired experiments). Preparations were secured by pinning the ciliary body to a silicone ring and maintained in 6 mL of medium for 84 days using a graded culture system: days 1-3, 5% human serum and 10 ng/mL transforming growth factor β (TGFβ2); days 4-7, 2% human serum and 1 ng/mL TGFβ2; days 8-14, 1% human serum and 0.1 ng/mL TGFβ2; days 15-84, serum-free Eagle's minimum essential medium (EMEM). A CT LUCIA 611PY IOL was implanted in all preparations. Quantitative measures were determined from whole bag images captured weekly. Images were registered using FIJI and analysed in ImageJ to determine capsular bag area; distortion; angle of contact; haptic stability; capsulorhexis area; and a fusion footprint associated with connection between the anterior and posterior capsules. Cell coverage and light scatter were quantified at end-point. The transdifferentiation marker, α-SMA was assessed by immunocytochemistry. Immediately following surgery, distortion of the capsular bag was evident, such that a long axis is generated between haptics relative to the non-haptic regions (short axis). The angle of contact between the haptics and the peripheral bag appeared inversely correlated to capsular bag area. Growth on the peripheral posterior capsule was observed 1 week after surgery and beneath the IOL within 1 month. As coverage of the posterior capsule progressed this was associated with matrix contraction/wrinkles of both the central posterior capsule and peripheral capsular bag. Cells on the central posterior capsule expressed αSMA. Fusion footprints formed in non-haptic regions of the peripheral bag and progressively increased over the culture period. Within and at the edge of the fusion footprint, refractive structures resembling lens fibre cells and Elschnig's pearls were observed. Cell attachment to the IOL was limited. An impression in the posterior capsule associated with the CT LUCIA 611PY optic edge was evident; cell density was much greater peripheral to this indent. Wound-healing events following surgery reduced capsular bag area. This was associated with the long/short axis ratio and angle of contact increasing with time. In summary, we have developed a human capsular bag model that exhibits features of fibrotic and regenerative PCO. The model permits biomechanical information to be obtained that enables better understanding of IOL characteristics in a clinically relevant biological system. Throughout culture the CT LUCIA 611PY appeared stable in its position and capsular bag modifications did not change this. We propose that the CT LUCIA 611PY optic edge shows an enhanced barrier function, which is likely to provide better PCO management in patients.";;;;Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Retrospective study of patients who had undergone cataract or RLE surgery and had received a FineVision Micro F intraocular lens. Laser enhancement of residual refractive error was determined. Visual acuity (VA) assessments were performed before and after surgery: uncorrected distance VA (UCDVA), best-corrected distance VA (BCDVA), uncorrected near VA (UCNVA), plus preoperative and postoperative spherical equivalent (SE) assessments.
Of the 1129 eyes from 596 patients, 61 (5.4%) required laser enhancement to correct residual refractive error (by group: 30/679 eyes [4.4%] cataract; 31/450 eyes [6.9%] RLE). Eleven eyes received FemtoLASIK; 50 eyes received PRK. Mean UCDVA before laser enhancement was 0.26±0.19 logMAR and 0.24±0.14 in the FemtoLASIK and PRK groups, respectively. After laser enhancement, these were 0.04±0.05 logMAR and 0.13±0.19, respectively; BCDVA values were 0.00±0.00 logMAR in the FemtoLASIK group and 0.06±0.11 in the PRK group. Laser enhancement improved UCNVA (Jaeger) from 2-3 to 1-2 in both groups. Enhancement reduced preoperative SE of -0.39±0.99 D and -0.53±0.58 D (FemtoLASIK and PRK groups, respectively) to 0.24±0.36 D and 0.04±0.47 D.
The FineVision Micro F trifocal lens is an effective solution for gaining increased spectacle independence. The incidence of residual refractive error requiring laser enhancement is low, and laser procedures are a safe and effective solution for improving the quality of vision and patient satisfaction.
Laser enhancement rates and outcomes were determined following cataract / refractive lens exchange surgery that used a trifocal IOL. Enhancement was safe and effective and rates were low (5.4%).";;;"Of the 1129 eyes from 596 patients, 61 (5.4%) required laser enhancement to correct residual refractive error (by group: 30/679 eyes [4.4%] cataract; 31/450 eyes [6.9%] RLE). Eleven eyes received FemtoLASIK; 50 eyes received PRK. Mean UCDVA before laser enhancement was 0.26±0.19 logMAR and 0.24±0.14 in the FemtoLASIK and PRK groups, respectively. After laser enhancement, these were 0.04±0.05 logMAR and 0.13±0.19, respectively; BCDVA values were 0.00±0.00 logMAR in the FemtoLASIK group and 0.06±0.11 in the PRK group. Laser enhancement improved UCNVA (Jaeger) from 2-3 to 1-2 in both groups. Enhancement reduced preoperative SE of -0.39±0.99 D and -0.53±0.58 D (FemtoLASIK and PRK groups, respectively) to 0.24±0.36 D and 0.04±0.47 D.";;"10.5507/bp.2021.010

266;33542371;Visual outcomes of lens subluxation surgery with Cionni modified capsular tension rings in Marfan syndrome.;[];Scientific reports;Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a hereditary disease with an incidence of 0.3% in the general population. Approximately 60% of MFS patients with FBN1 gene mutation will suffer ectopia lentis (EL) from the age of 3. With the development of EL, severe loss of vision will accrue because of lens tilt and glaucoma. Cionni modified capsular tension rings (MCTR) has been applied in the surgery for EL in MFS patients. To evaluate visual acuity and safety of using MCTR during lens subluxation surgery in MFS patients, 66 MFS patients (110 eyes) were included in our study, with the mean duration of follow-up of 4.7 months (SD 1.76 months). The capsular bags were preserved in 101 eyes (91.81%) with MCTR implantation. There was an overall significant improvement in BCVA at 1-month follow-up which was maintained at 3 months. Multivariable linear regression revealed that older age at first visit was associated with greater postoperative BCVA at the 1-month follow-up (P = 0.007). A significant difference was found between different degrees of lens subluxation and the length of surgical time and complications. At follow-up, only two eyes (1.98%) were identified to have developed retinal detachments. In conclusion, better visual outcomes can be achieved when patients received an early operation with MCTR implantation.;;;;;10.1038/s41598-021-82586-6;2021-02-06;[{'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Tianhui', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Science, Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University, 83 Fenyang Rd, Shanghai, 200031, China.\nKey Laboratory of Myopia of State Health Ministry, and Key Laboratory of Visual Impairment and Restoration of Shanghai, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Deng', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Science, Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University, 83 Fenyang Rd, Shanghai, 200031, China.\nKey Laboratory of Myopia of State Health Ministry, and Key Laboratory of Visual Impairment and Restoration of Shanghai, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Min', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Science, Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University, 83 Fenyang Rd, Shanghai, 200031, China.\nKey Laboratory of Myopia of State Health Ministry, and Key Laboratory of Visual Impairment and Restoration of Shanghai, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Jiahui', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Science, Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University, 83 Fenyang Rd, Shanghai, 200031, China.\nKey Laboratory of Myopia of State Health Ministry, and Key Laboratory of Visual Impairment and Restoration of Shanghai, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Zexu', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Science, Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University, 83 Fenyang Rd, Shanghai, 200031, China.\nKey Laboratory of Myopia of State Health Ministry, and Key Laboratory of Visual Impairment and Restoration of Shanghai, Shanghai, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Jiang', 'firstname': 'Yongxiang', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Science, Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University, 83 Fenyang Rd, Shanghai, 200031, China. yongxiang_jiang@163.com.\nKey Laboratory of Myopia of State Health Ministry, and Key Laboratory of Visual Impairment and Restoration of Shanghai, Shanghai, China. yongxiang_jiang@163.com.'}]

This was a retrospective cohort study among patients receiving Tecnis Symfony implantation, an extended-range-of-vision intraocular lens, during October 2016-January 2020 at Daqing Oilfield General Hospital, China. Four different predictive models were used to predict good post-operative DoF (⩾2.5 D): Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost), random forest (RF), LASSO penalized regression, and multivariable logistic regression (MLR). Apriori algorithm was employed to further explore the association between patient attributes and DoF.
A total of 182 unique cases (143 patients) were included. The XGBoost model produced the best predictive accuracy compared to RF, LASSO, and MLR models. Overall performance of the best fitting XGBoost model was as follows: accuracy = 70.3%, AUC = 80.2%, sensitivity = 65.5%, and specificity = 87.5%. The Apriori algorithm identified six preoparative attributes with substantial effects on good post-operative DoF: low anterior chamber depth (ACD) (1.9 to <2.5 mm), smaller pupil size (1.7 to <2.5 mm), low-to-mid axial length (21 to <23 mm), minimum astigmatism degree (-0.2 to 0 diopter), low IOP (9 to <12 mmHg), and medium lens target refractive error (-0.5 to <-0.25 diopter).

269;33527973;Surface modification of intraocular lenses via photodynamic coating for safe and effective PCO prevention.;[];Journal of materials chemistry. B;Posterior capsular opacification (PCO) is an emerging complication in cataract phacoemulsification and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation surgery, mainly stemming from the adhesion, proliferation, and trans-differentiation of the post-surgery residual lens epithelial cells (LECs). Previous investigations have shown that an anti-proliferative drug eluting coating on the IOL surface provides an effective way to inhibit PCO. However, due to the undesirable elution of the anti-proliferative drug, the safety of such modification is one of the important issues to be solved. In this investigation, photodynamic coating was introduced into IOL surface modification. The photosensitizer chlorin e6 grafted α-cyclodextrin (α-CD-Ce6) was synthesized and self-assembled onto the poly(poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate) (PPEGMA) brush established IOL surface via the supramolecular interaction between α-CD and poly(ethylene glycol) chains. The results of investigation into its optical properties, including transmittance, refractive index, and surface morphology, showed no obvious alterations after photodynamic coating modification on the IOL surface. The in vitro LEC behaviour investigation optimized the photodynamic therapy parameters when light illumination was used for the cell elimination on the photodynamic coating modified IOL. The results have also shown that this functional coating modification effectively eliminates the cells on the surface of the IOL material when treated with light illumination, whereas it keeps excellent cytocompatibility in the absence of light illumination. The investigation of the cell elimination mechanism shows that this kind of functional coating eliminates the adherent cells by ROS induced apoptosis. The in vivo implantation result confirms the excellent PCO inhibition effect, as well as their safety and biocompatibility to the surrounding tissues. As a result, the proposed photodynamic coating provides a safer and effective alternative of IOL modification for preventing PCO.;;;;;10.1039/d0tb02802a;2021-02-03;[{'lastname': 'Tang', 'firstname': 'Junmei', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'School of Ophthalmology & Optometry, Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, 270 Xueyuan Road, Wenzhou 325027, China. chenhao823@mail.eye.ac.cn linqk@wmu.edu.cn.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Sihao', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'School of Ophthalmology & Optometry, Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, 270 Xueyuan Road, Wenzhou 325027, China. chenhao823@mail.eye.ac.cn linqk@wmu.edu.cn.'}, {'lastname': 'Han', 'firstname': 'Yuemei', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'School of Ophthalmology & Optometry, Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, 270 Xueyuan Road, Wenzhou 325027, China. chenhao823@mail.eye.ac.cn linqk@wmu.edu.cn.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Rui', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'School of Ophthalmology & Optometry, Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, 270 Xueyuan Road, Wenzhou 325027, China. chenhao823@mail.eye.ac.cn linqk@wmu.edu.cn.'}, {'lastname': 'Xia', 'firstname': 'Jiayi', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'School of Ophthalmology & Optometry, Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, 270 Xueyuan Road, Wenzhou 325027, China. chenhao823@mail.eye.ac.cn linqk@wmu.edu.cn.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Hao', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'School of Ophthalmology & Optometry, Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, 270 Xueyuan Road, Wenzhou 325027, China. chenhao823@mail.eye.ac.cn linqk@wmu.edu.cn.'}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Quankui', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'School of Ophthalmology & Optometry, Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, 270 Xueyuan Road, Wenzhou 325027, China. chenhao823@mail.eye.ac.cn linqk@wmu.edu.cn.'}]

In this consecutive case series, cataract extraction and IOL implantation cases from two surgical centers in Toronto, Canada, were recruited between January 2015 and July 2017. Differences between ultrasound (applanation or immersion A-scan) and optical biometry (IOLMaster 500) were compared for axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth and refractive outcomes. The primary outcome was the percentage of cases in each cohort within ± 0.50D of refractive error.

Only patients with preexisting anterior corneal astigmatism <2.00 diopters (D) and ≥0.50 D who underwent a steep meridian clear corneal incision were included. Primary outcomes were 3rd- to 6th-order anterior corneal higher-order aberrations with an 8-mm pupil. Anterior corneal astigmatism and effective phaco time were evaluated as secondary outcomes. Preoperative and 3-month postoperative outcomes were evaluated.
Anterior corneal astigmatism significantly decreased after both procedures; however, there was no significant difference found in surgically induced anterior corneal astigmatism between the two procedures (p=0.146). Although the total higher-order aberrations did not significantly change after both procedures, the group comparison showed a significant difference in surgically induced total higher-order aberrations (a decrease of 0.337 ± 1.156 mm in 2.2-mm coaxial micro-incision cataract surgery and an increase of 0.106 ± 0.521 mm in 2.75-mm coaxial small-incision cataract surgery, p=0.046).

281;33422509;An in vitro system to investigate IOL: Lens capsule interaction.;['3D model', 'Adhesion force', 'Gelatin', 'In vitro model', 'Intraocular lens', 'Lens capsule', 'Posterior capsule opacification'];Experimental eye research;Posterior capsule opacification (PCO) is the most common complication associated with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Unfortunately, current in vitro models cannot be used to assess the potential of PCO due to their failure to simulate the posterior curvature of the lens capsule (LC) and IOL, a factor known to affect PCO pathogenesis in clinic. To overcome such a challenge, a new system to study IOL: LC interaction and potentially predict PCO was developed in this effort. It is believed that the interactions between an IOL and the lens capsule may influence the extent of PCO formation. Specifically, strong adhesion force between an IOL and the LC may impede lens epithelial cell migration and proliferation and thus reduce PCO formation. To assess the adhesion force between an IOL and LC, a new in vitro model was established with simulated LC and a custom-designed micro-force tester. A method to fabricate simulated LCs was developed by imprinting IOLs onto molten gelatin to create simulated three dimensional (3D) LCs with curvature resembling the bag-like structure that collapses on the IOL post implantation. By pushing the LC mold vertically downward, while measuring the change in position of the bending bar with respect to its start position, the adhesion force between the IOLs and LCs was measured. An in vitro system that can measure the adhesion force reproducibly between an IOL and LC with a resolution of ~1 μN was established in this study. During system optimization, the 10% high molecular weight gelatin produced the best LC with the highest IOL: LC adhesion force with all test lenses that were fabricated from acrylic foldable, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and silicone materials. Test IOLs exerted different adhesion force with the 3D simulated LCs in the following sequence: acrylic foldable IOL > silicone IOL > PMMA IOL. These results are in good agreement with the clinical observations associated with PCO performance of IOLs made of the same materials.

This retrospective case series included 57 eyes (56 patients) of aphakia or phakic and pseudophakic eyes with insufficient capsular support that underwent IOL implantation or dislocated IOL repositioning with scleral fixation using the 'suspension bridge' method by a single surgeon between 1 July 2010 and 1 March 2019. Preoperative status, changes in visual acuity, refractive outcomes as spherical equivalent and related complications were assessed with a minimum follow-up of 3 months.
The mean follow-up period was 25.5 ± 25.4 months. Preoperative visual acuity (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) was 1.32 ± 0.68 (20/400 Snellen), and it significantly improved to 0.80 ± 0.53 (20/125), 0.59 ± 0.56 (20/80) and 0.24 ± 0.37 (20/35) at 1 week, 1 month and 3 months, respectively (p < 0.001). Postoperative complications included corneal wound dehiscence (n = 1), vitreous incarceration (n = 1), optic-iris capture (n = 6) and cystoid macular oedema (n = 1). The above-mentioned complications were successfully corrected with simple procedures. However, one case of IOL dislocation required reoperation.

283;33420421;Biometric refractive error after cataract and retina surgery: a systematic review and a benchmark proposal.;[];Eye (London, England);"To systematically review studies on refractive error after phacovitrectomy and phacoemulsification and to investigate factors associated with larger error.
A literature search was performed using PUBMED and EMBASE until May 2020. The articles were included in the study if they reported data about refractive error as the difference in spherical equivalent between actual vs. target refraction in patients who underwent phacovitrectomy and phacoemulsification according to the type of biometry (ultrasound or optical). An inverse variance meta-analysis technique was used to pool errors; standard deviations (SDs), which are an expression of random error, were reported descriptively as median and range of the 95% coefficient of reproducibility (95% CR: 1.96 SD).
Twenty-one studies (197,353 eyes) were included. The mean error obtained using optical biometry was negligible for phacoemulsification (0.04 D, 95% CI: -0.04 to 0.12; 8 studies, 587 eyes) and was consistent with larger datasets using mixed biometric methods (0.02, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.04; 5 studies, 194,522 eyes). A trend towards hyperopia was found with ultrasound biometry after phacoemulsification (+0.21 D, 0.00-0.42 D; 7 studies, 394 eyes). Mean error after phacovitrectomy was clinically insignificant with optical biometry (-0.10 D, -0.22 to 0.02;, 8 studies, 453 eyes), and) and a mild myopic shift was possible with ultrasound biometry (-0.39 D, 95% CI: -0.68 to -0.09 D; 6 studies, 529 eyes). The 95% CR was greater and more variable with ultrasound biometry in patients who underwent phacovitrectomy (median 1.75 D, range 0.47-2.5) while it was consistent and lower with optical biometry in patients who underwent phacoemulsification (median 0.96 D, range 0.60-1.2]).
Phacovitrectomy causes a mild myopic shift compared to phacoemulsification, which is clinically relevant only with ultrasound biometry. Furthermore, our review provides estimates of fixed and random error for postoperative vs. target spherical equivalent as a continuous variable, that is easy to use as benchmark for quality assurance.";;;"Twenty-one studies (197,353 eyes) were included.

CTR implantation in cataract patients with weak zonules.;['Capsular tension ring', 'Cataract', 'Pars plana vitrectomy', 'Phacoemulsification', 'Severe myopia', 'Weak zonules'];BMC ophthalmology;"The use of capsular tension ring (CTR) implantation to treat cataract patients with weak zonules is still controversial. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of CTR implantation on capsular stability after phacoemulsification in patients with weak zonules, especially patients who have undergone pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) or those who suffer from severe myopia.
A total of 42 patients who underwent phacoemulsification and received an intraocular lens (IOL) were randomized to undergo CTR implantation or not. The control and CTR groups were compared in terms of uncorrected distant visual acuity (UDVA), best corrected distant visual acuity (BCDVA), refractive prediction error, the area of anterior capsulorhexis, and IOL inclination angle. Follow-up visits were conducted postoperatively at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month and 3 months. Subgroup analyses were performed based on PPV and severe myopia.
Surgery significantly improved UDVA and BCDVA to similar extents in CTR and control patients, and refraction prediction error was similar between the two groups at all follow-up times. At 3 months after surgery, the area of anterior capsulorhexis was significantly larger in CTR patients than in controls (p = 0.0199). These differences were also significant between the subgroups of patients with severe myopia. Vertical IOL inclination was less within CTR groups at 3 months after surgery, especially in patients with severe myopia (p = 0.0286). At 1 week postoperatively, the proportion of individuals whose posterior lens capsule that had completely adhered to the posterior IOL surface was significantly higher among CTR patients (p = 0.023). No serious surgical complications were observed.

However, MIOL also have shortcomings, including decreased contrast sensitivity, night glare, halos and other negative dysphotopsias, despite strictly controlled indications. Sometimes dysphotopsia can be relieved spontaneously after surgery in a period of time. During this process neuroadaptation plays an important role. This article explains the concept and mechanism of neuroadaptation, the location of neuroadaptation in the central nervous system, cognitive training, the preoperative evaluation of MIOL implantation, and the treatment for postoperative dissatisfaction. Correct understanding of the important role of neuroadaptation will provide theoretic foundation for cataract specialists and facilitate the handling of complications after MIOL implantation.

For this prospective study, we enlisted cataract surgery patients in our hospital with preoperative diagnoses of weak zonules. All patients received phacoemulsification surgery with implantation of a hydrophobic acrylic IOL and capsular tension ring (CTR). ACO reductions were measured for six months after enrolment. Data on late IOL dislocations were collected five years after enrolment of the last patient.
Fifty-three patients were enrolled from 2011 to 2015. Over the six-month active follow-up period, ACO area reduction was 23% in patients receiving CTRs of 11 mm diameter and 8% for patients with CTRs of 12 mm, with an overall mean of 15% reduction. Five years after the last patient was enrolled, seven patients (13%) had experienced late IOL-CTR-capsular bag dislocation. For these patients, the mean ACO reduction in the first six months of follow-up was 33%, including for those who had received neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd: YAG) anterior capsulotomies.
Use of hydrophobic acrylic lenses and CTR reduces ACO contraction, with rates comparable to those after cataract surgery without ocular comorbidity. Our patients experienced a relatively high rate of late IOL-CTR-capsular bag dislocation. However, dislocated complexes were easily repositioned and few patients required IOL exchange.

The purpose of this study was to compare postoperative refractive outcomes in patients with glaucoma who underwent phacoemulsification and IOL implantation with or without ECP and the change in intraocular pressure (IOP) and number of antiglaucoma medications between groups.
A cross-sectional study in which the medical records of the patients with any type of glaucoma, who underwent phacoemulsification with IOL implantation in the capsular bag in addition to ECP or as a standalone procedure from June 2016 to August 2019 were analyzed. Clinical data collected included axial length, steep, flat, and mean keratometry values, target spherical equivalent (SE) estimated by the SRK/T formula, manifest refraction SE at the 1-month follow-up, IOP, and number of antiglaucoma medications before and 12 months after surgery. Primary and secondary outcome measures were the mean predictive error (MPE), the postoperative SE, and the change in IOP after surgery in both groups, respectively. Significance was assessed using the Student t test for all variables between groups according to data distribution. P-values <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.

The study included 54 children (72 eyes) aged 4 to 12 years who had undergone CC removal with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation at the age of 2-11 months. Examination included: visual acuity testing, Flicker ERG 30 Hz electroretinography (MBN, Russia), optical coherence tomography (HRT-OCT) on the Heidelberg Spectralis (Heidelberg Engineering, Germany) platform.
The best results were obtained after removal of bilateral congenital cataract (BCC): BCVA in 58.0% of cases was 0.15-0.3, and in 12.0% of cases - 0.4-0.8. BCVA was 0.1 or less in 95.5% of cases and only one child had 0.2 after removal of unilateral congenital cataract (UCC).

299;33336672;Enhanced PCO prevention of drug eluting IOLs ;[];Journal of materials chemistry. B;Drug-loaded intraocular lenses (IOLs) have received considerable attention in treating complications that arise after cataract surgery, especially posterior capsular opacification (PCO). However, for a better therapeutic effect, the drug concentration in IOLs usually needs to be increased. Herein, we developed multilayer (doxorubicin (DOX)@polyaminoamide (PAMAM) (D@P)/heparin sodium (HEP))5 modified IOLs, which efficiently enhance the inhibitory effect on PCO using the enhanced autophagy effect of a cationic PAMAM. The chemotherapeutic drug DOX was encapsulated in PAMAM to formulate cationic DOX@PAMAM nanoparticles. Subsequently, negatively charged HEP and D@P nanoparticles (NPs) were assembled on the aminated artificial IOL surface using the layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly technique. The (D@P/HEP)5 IOLs were implanted into rabbit eyes to evaluate the prevention of PCO. In vitro and in vivo research studies showed that the D@P NPs exhibited enhanced cellular uptake owing to the cell-penetrating cationic characteristics, while demonstrating enhanced autophagy. D@P NPs are more effective at the same DOX concentration when compared to free DOX. Multilayer-modified (D@P/HEP)5 IOLs can efficiently inhibit PCO after cataract surgery. This study provides a strategy for improving the therapeutic effect of antiproliferative drug DOX by using a cationic dendrimer, which, in turn, increases the level of autophagy of cells. These LBL-based multilayer IOLs have broad application prospects in the treatment of complications after cataract surgery.;;;;;10.1039/d0tb02530e;2020-12-19;[{'lastname': 'Qin', 'firstname': 'Chen', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'School of Ophthalmology & Optometry, Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, 270 Xueyuan Road, Wenzhou 325027, China. chenhao823@mail.eye.ac.cn linqk@wmu.edu.cn.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Sihao', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wen', 'firstname': 'Shimin', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Han', 'firstname': 'Yuemei', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Siqi', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Qie', 'firstname': 'Jiqiao', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Hao', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Quankui', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': None}]

The risk of glaucoma plus  glaucoma suspect diagnosis after cataract removal rose from 12% (95% CI, 7%-20%) at 1 year, to 31% (95% CI, 24%-41%) at 5 years, to 40% (95% CI, 32%-50%) at 10 years. Risk of glaucoma and glaucoma plus glaucoma suspect diagnosis at 10 years was not significantly different between treatment groups. Eyes with glaucoma (compared with eyes with glaucoma suspect or neither) had longer axial length but relatively preserved RNFL and similar ONH appearance and visual acuity at age 10 years.
Risk of glaucoma-related adverse events continues to increase with longer follow-up of children following unilateral cataract removal in infancy and is not associated with primary IOL implantation. Development of glaucoma (or glaucoma suspect) after removal of unilateral congenital cataract was not associated with worse visual acuity outcomes at 10 years.

A literature search was performed to identify publications reporting clinical outcomes of patients measured with commercial SS-OCT. Twenty-nine studies were included in this review. A comprehensive analysis of the available data was performed, focusing on parameters used for intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation in cataract surgery, including keratometry, central corneal thickness, white-to-white distance, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, axial length, IOL power, and pupil diameter. Different metrics for repeatability, reproducibility, and agreement between devices were analyzed. In general, SS-OCT biometers provide excellent repeatability and reproducibility outcomes; however, the differences obtained for some parameters measured in agreement studies should be carefully analyzed to validate the interchangeability between devices. The good outcomes reported lead us to conclude that optical biometers based on SS-OCT technology are likely to become the gold standard for ocular biometry.";;;;Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Ideal toric axis was calculated using the back-calculator astigmatismfix.com.
The study consists of 39 treated eyes (20 [51%] right eyes). The toric IOLs showed a postoperative misalignment of 25.69 ± 26.06°. Postrotational, uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) improved from 0.39 ± 0.29 logMAR to 0.27 ± 0.18 logMAR. Refractive outcome showed a reduction of residual sphere and cylinder. The postoperative UDVA when performing alignment to the preoperative calculated axis (51%) was 0.24 ± 0.16 logMAR with a cylinder of 0.90 ± 0.90 diopter (D). In the group with alignment to a back-calculated axis (49%), the UDVA was 0.32 ± 0.20 logMAR with a cylinder of 0.76 ± 0.72 D.

This review comprised 770 eyes of 403 consecutive patients undergoing ICL extraction. We evaluated prevalence, etiology, uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), predictability, and patient satisfaction. ICL extraction was required in 8 of 770 (1.0%) eyes. The most common reason was the progression of the pre-existing cataract formation in 5 eyes (63%), followed by residual refractive errors in 3 eyes (38%). Of the 7 eyes targeted for emmetropia, 7 (100%) and 6 (86%) achieved UDVAs of 20/40 and 20/20 or better, respectively. Three eyes (38%) showed no change in CDVA, 3 eyes (38%) gained 1 line, 2 eyes (25%) gained 3 or more lines. 88% and 100% were within ± 0.5 and 1.0 diopter (D), respectively, of the targeted correction. Patient satisfaction improved significantly, from 3.0 ± 1.4 preoperatively, to 8.0 ± 2.4 postoperatively. No vision-threatening complications occurred.

However, when a PMCD patient develops a cataract, it provides a golden opportunity to treat this coexisting astigmatism with toric intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Regular toric IOLs would correct astigmatism only up to 6 diopters in the IOL plane but higher astigmatism would require customization of such IOLs.

We aimed to characterize the cells in the lens capsules (LCs) of 18 patients with spontaneous late in-the-bag IOL dislocation. Patients' average age was 82.6 ± 1.5 years (range 72-98), and most of them had pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PEX). Cells from the LCs were positive for myofibroblast (αSMA), proliferation (Ki-67, PCNA), early lens development/lens progenitor (SOX2, PAX6), chemokine receptor (CXCR4), and transmembrane (N-cadherin) markers, while negative for epithelial (E-cadherin) marker. Moreover, the cells produced abundant fibronectin, type I and type V collagen in the nearby extracellular matrix (ECM). During ex vivo cultivation of dislocated IOL-LCs in toto, the cells proliferated and likely migrated onto the IOL's anterior side. EdU proliferation assay confirmed the proliferation potential of the myofibroblasts (MFBs) in dislocated IOL-LCs. Primary cultured lens epithelial cells/MFBs isolated from the LC of dislocated IOLs could induce collagen matrix contraction and continuously proliferated, migrated, and induced ECM remodeling. Taken together, this indicates that long-lived MFBs of dislocated IOLs might contribute to the pathogenic mechanisms in late in-the-bag IOL dislocation.;;;;;10.1038/s41598-020-77207-7;2020-11-27;[{'lastname': 'Bisevac', 'firstname': 'Jovana', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Center for Eye Research, Department of Ophthalmology, University of Oslo and Oslo University Hospital, Kirkeveien 166, 0450, Oslo, Norway.\nInstitute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Anisimova', 'firstname': 'Natalia S', 'initials': 'NS', 'affiliation': 'S.

Data of all patients waiting for cataract surgery were analyzed at the beginning of May 2020, after 2 months without performing elective surgery. The waiting time since surgical inscription was considered an independent and overriding factor. In addition, higher priority was given to patients with white or brunescent cataracts and patients with low visual acuity: corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) of 20/200 or less in binocular patients or CDVA of 20/63 or less in monocular patients. Criteria of medium priority included patients who remained with anisometropia and patients with glaucoma or low to moderate risk for chronic angle closure. Data of scheduled surgeries in the following months were then analyzed.
A total of 717 patients were waiting for phacoemulsification. One hundred ninety-one patients (26.64%) were on the waiting list more than 4.5 months; the medium waiting time was 3.51 ± 1.57 months.

323;33223144;Altered stress field of the human lens capsule after cataract surgery.;['Biomechanics', 'Computational modeling', 'Hyperelasticity', 'Intraocular lens', 'Lens capsule'];Journal of biomechanics;The lens capsule of the eye is important in focusing light onto the retina during the process of accommodation and, in later life, housing a prosthetic lens implanted during cataract surgery. Though considerable modeling work has characterized the mechanics of accommodation, little has been done to understand the mechanics of the lens capsule after cataract surgery. As such, we present the first 3-D finite element model of the post-surgical human lens capsule with an implanted tension ring and, separately, an intraocular lens to characterize the altered stress field compared to that in a model of the native lens capsule. All finite element models employed a Holzapfel hyperelastic constitutive model with regional variations in anisotropy. The post-surgical lens capsule demonstrated a dramatic perturbation to the stress field with mostly large reductions in stresses (except at the equator where the implant contacts the capsule) compared to native, wherein maximal changes in Cauchy stress were -100% and -145% for the tension ring and intraocular lens, respectively. However, implantation of the tension ring produced a more uniform stress field compared to the IOL. The magnitudes and distribution of the perturbed stress field may be an important driver of the fibrotic response of inhabiting lens epithelial cells and associated lens capsule remodeling after cataract surgery. Thus, the mechanical effects of an implant on the lens capsule could be an essential consideration in the design of intraocular lenses, particularly those with an accommodative feature.;;;;Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

326;33218991;Immediate versus delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery in children: a cost-effectiveness analysis.;['child health (paediatrics)', 'treatment surgery'];The British journal of ophthalmology;"Children with bilateral cataracts may undergo immediate sequential bilateral cataract surgery (ISBCS), which involves surgery on both eyes during the same general anaesthesia, or delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery (DSBCS), which involves operating on each eye on separate days and requires a second anaesthesia. ISBCS is viewed with caution because of the risk of bilateral endophthalmitis. Proponents of ISBCS emphasise that the incidence of serious complications is low and is outweighed by benefits such as avoidance of multiple anaesthesia, faster visual rehabilitation and potential for decreased costs. However, there is a paucity of literature regarding the cost-effectiveness of ISBCS in children. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis to determine whether ISBCS is more cost-effective than DSBCS from the societal and health system perspectives in Ontario, Canada, which has a universal, single-payer system.
A retrospective analysis of children who underwent ISBCS or DSBCS at a tertiary referral paediatric hospital was conducted. A decision tree was constructed using TreeAge Pro 2018 software. Clear visual axis was the measure of effectiveness. A time horizon of 8 weeks postoperatively was adopted. Both direct and indirect costs were included.
Fifty-three children were included, 37 in the ISBCS group and 16 in the DSBCS group. ISBCS and DSBCS were equally effective. ISBCS resulted in cost-savings of $3,776 (95% CI:-$4,641 to $12,578) CAD, per patient, from the societal perspective and $2,200 (95% CI:-$5,615 to $10,373) CAD per patient from the health system perspective.

Caused by various forms of trauma, the course and prognosis of traumatic cataract are also different. Intraocular lens (IOL) implantation is the most effective treatment at the present time and can provide good visual quality and near, medium, and far vision. In this study, an adaptive medical ultrasound image denoising algorithm was constructed based on the biological vision mechanism and was applied to observe IOL implantation and postoperative care of 30 patients with traumatic cataract. Results showed that eyesight could be restored to the original healthy state after IOL implantation, and eyesight was close to normal 3 months after surgery. The corresponding noise pixel block of the noise reduction algorithm was obviously the lowest. A total of 30 patients (9 patients with contusion, 13 patients with intraocular foreign body, and 8 patients with perforation) were treated with aspheric and multifocal IOL to achieve the expected outcome. The noise reduction algorithm constructed in this study effectively reduced the speckle noise of ultrasound images, improved the clarity of ultrasound images, and achieved the effective observation of medical nursing outcome after traumatic cataract IOL implantation.

This is a retrospective study of cataract phacoemulsification combined with intraocular lens implantation in patients with steep curvature cornea (corneal curvature ≥ 46D). The refractive prediction errors of IOL power calculation formulas (SRK/T, Haigis, Holladay, Hoffer Q, and Barrett Universal II) using User Group for Laser Interference Biometry (ULIB) constants were evaluated and compared. Objective refraction results were assessed at one month postoperatively. According to axial length (AL), all patients were divided into three groups: short AL group (<22mm), normal AL group (>22 to ≤24.5mm) and long AL group (>24.5mm). Calculate the refractive error and absolute refractive error (AE) between the actual postoperative refractive power and the predicted postoperative refractive power. The covariance analysis was used for the comparison of five formulas in each group. The correlation between the absolute refractive error and AL from every formula were analyzed by Pearson correlation test, respectively.
Total 112 eyes of 83 cataract patients with steep curvature cornea were collected. The anterior chamber depth (ACD) was a covariate in the short AL group in the covariance analysis of absolute refractive error (P<0.001). The SRK/T and Holladay formula had the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) (0.47D), there were statistically significant differences in MAE between the five formulas for short AL group (P = 0.024). The anterior chamber depth had no significant correlation in the five calculation formulas in the normal AL group and long AL group (P = 0.521, P = 0.609 respectively). In the normal AL group, there was no significant difference in MAE between the five calculation formulas (P = 0.609). In the long AL group, Barrett Universal II formula had the lowest MAE (0.35), and there were statistically significant differences in MAE between the five formulas (P = 0.012). Over the entire AL range, the Barrett Universal II formula had the lowest MAE and the highest percentage of eyes within ± 0.50 D, ± 1.00 D, and ± 1.50 D (69.6%, 93.8%, and 98.2% respectively).

The optical performance of such combination was obtained after combining ray tracing and Fourier optics. A pre-clinical validation was also evaluated incorporating clinical data from three different keratoconus eyes of three patients. The implantation of the Mplus IOL can compensate or reduce the overall coma of the eye with keratoconus improving the quality of vision compared with a spherical monofocal IOL due to lower displacements of the retinal image or tilting in keratoconus.

The patients were divided into two groups depending on their post-operation phakic status (with or without IOL implantation). Infants aged from 6 to 12 months from two groups were analyzed as subgroups, respectively. B-scan ultrasonography was performed before the procedure and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12-month follow-ups, respectively, after the operation.
Of the 131 eyes included in the analyses, 74 were aphakic, and 57 were pseudophakic after surgery. The postoperative rate of PVD in all analyzed eyes was 6.9% (9 of 131 eyes). After 12 months, PVD was significantly more prevalent in the eyes that underwent cataract surgery with IOL implantation (10.5%, 6 of 57 eyes) compared to the eyes without IOL implantation (4.1%, 1 of 74 eyes, P < 0.05); however, the eyes in the aphakic group were significantly younger than the eyes in the pseudophakic group, while the mean axial length (AL) of the pseudophakic eyes (21.11 ± 2.07 mm) was significantly higher than that of the aphakic eyes (18.93 ± 1.86 mm) (P < 0.01). In patients between the ages of 6 and 12 months of age from the two groups, the AL of patients with IOL implantation continued to be significantly increased compared to the group without IOL implantation (20.44 ± 1.68 mm vs. 19.78 ± 1.52 mm, P < 0.01). At the follow-up appointments, two patients with PVD were observed among the 14 eyes that had undergone cataract surgery with IOL implantation, while one eye was observed to have developed PVD among the 15 eyes without IOL implantation.
PVD occurs with greater frequency after congenital cataract surgery, particularly in eyes that have undergone IOL implantation. We suggest that PVD should be carefully monitored in children after congenital cataract surgery to avoid subsequent ocular pathologies such as retinal detachment. Future studies are needed to determine other potential risk factors that have not been as thoroughly explored, as opposed to better-known factors such as older age, longer axial length, and IOL implantation.";;;"Of the 131 eyes included in the analyses, 74 were aphakic, and 57 were pseudophakic after surgery.

This procedure results in a refractive shift that is difficult to predict. The aim of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that the refractive shift in the second eye follows the shift in the first eye.
In this retrospective, single-center, consecutive case series, the refractive outcomes of 254 eyes of 127 patients who underwent DMEK + cataract/IOL triple procedure in both eyes for Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy have been analyzed. Main outcome measures were spherical equivalent outcome (shift calculations), best spectacle-corrected visual acuity, central corneal thickness, and posterior simulated keratometry.
The mean best spectacle-corrected visual acuity before surgery was 0.51 ± 0.24 and increased to 0.19 ± 0.15 (logMAR) after surgery (P < 0.001). After surgery, a mean hyperopic shift of 0.98 ± 0.89 D was observed. The refractive shift was 1.03 ± 0.93 D and 0.92 ± 1.02 D, in the first and second eyes, respectively (P = 0.435). In a paired analysis, the mean difference of the refractive shift between the first and second eyes was 0.49 ± 0.43 D.
In our fellow eye comparison, the refractive shift after DMEK + cataract/IOL triple procedure in the second eye was comparable with the shift in the first eye. As a consequence, the refractive outcome of the first eye might serve as a reference for optimizing the refractive target in the second eye. Further studies investigating the influence of corneal parameters on refractive shift are needed for a more predictable lens power selection.";;;The mean best spectacle-corrected visual acuity before surgery was 0.51 ± 0.24 and increased to 0.19 ± 0.15 (logMAR) after surgery (P < 0.001).

Disassembly of a brunescent nucleus is more difficult because of the thickened, leathery posterior plate. Relying on mechanical forces, miLOOP nucleotomy reduces ultrasound time and is assured of bisecting the posterior nuclear plate. However, using this instrument with brunescent nuclei might impart significant stress on the zonular fibers and posterior capsule, particularly if there is no epinuclear shell. Evacuating the liquefied cortex and prolapsing one nuclear pole through capsulorhexis with ophthalmic viscosurgical devices create enough space to implant an intraocular lens (IOL) into the capsular bag beneath the undivided nucleus. This IOL scaffold shields the floppy posterior capsule and stabilizes the nucleus and zonular fibers during miLOOP nucleotomy.

1691 patients with bilateral immature cataract were included in the study. The feasibility of these IOLs was calculated by studying ocular parameters using Visionix VX120 and subjective characteristics. A prospective study was then conducted in 148 eyes of 74 patients in which multifocal IOLs were implanted. Their visual outcome was assessed using LogMAR for distance and Snellen's chart for near vision, contrast sensitivity by Pelli-Robson chart, and satisfaction using visual function-7 questionnaire.
Considering ocular and subjective characteristics, it was feasible to implant the lens in 920 patients (54.40%) and the acceptability rate was 8.04%, most common reason for decreased acceptability was cost (85%) of IOL. The median distance uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) at day 7 and at 30 days was LogMAR 0.2 (0.1-0.3) and 0.15 (0.1-0.2), respectively, which was statistically significant compared to preoperative distance UCVA (P < 0.001). The median near UCVA at day 7 and 30 days was N6 for both and statistically significant (P < 0.001) compared to preoperative near UCVA. 77.02% patients had distance UCVA of LogMAR (0.0-0.2) and 91.8% had near UCVA of N6-N8 at 30 days. The contrast sensitivity was decreased in all patients.

Thus, the physicochemical properties of the IOL become a critical issue, and several types of postoperative IOL opacifications have been reported.
To describe the microscopic characteristics of opacified IOLs. Glistenings and subsurface nanoglistenings are fluid-related phenomena developing mainly in hydrophobic acrylic IOLs and are associated with aqueous influx into the IOL matrix. Calcification presents in hydrophilic acrylic or silicone IOLs as deposits of hydroxyapatite or other phases of calcium. Snowflake degeneration is less common, and it manifests in older polymethyl methacrylate IOLs.
PubMed and ScienceDirect databases were searched for the following keywords: intraocular lens, IOL, cataract surgery, phacoemulsification, opacification, glistening, subsurface nanoglistenings, calcification, snowflake degeneration. English-language articles published up to October 15, 2019 were included in the study. The manuscript contains mainly a literature review; however, it was supplemented with original investigations from the David J. Apple International Laboratory for Ocular Pathology.
Glistenings and subsurface nanoglistenings should be evaluated in a hydrated state and at room temperature; they manifest as microvacuoles sized from 1.0 to greater than 25.0 μm and less than 200 nm, respectively. Calcification deposits are situated on or underneath the surface of the IOL and can be stained with a 1% alizarin red solution or with the von Kossa method. Snowflake degeneration manifests as ""particles"" or ""crystals,"" causing whitish IOL discoloration. Scanning electron microscopy or energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy may improve the diagnostic accuracy.";;;;;10.5858/arpa.2019-0626-RA;2020-10-23;[{'lastname': 'Kanclerz', 'firstname': 'Piotr', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'From the Department of Ophthalmology, Hygeia Clinic, Gdańsk, Poland (Kanclerz).'}, {'lastname': 'Yildirim', 'firstname': 'Timur Mert', 'initials': 'TM', 'affiliation': 'The David J.

How to prevent PCO has been a challenge to scientists and ophthalmologists for decades. Here we demonstrated the use of carboxylated CuInS/ZnS quantum dots (ZCIS QDs), which are free of toxic heavy metals and are more biocompatible, as photothermal nanomedicines. The ZCIS QDs are modified onto the non-optical section of IOLs by a facial activation-immersion method. Under mild NIR laser irradiation, ZCIS QDs modified IOLs (QDs-IOLs) will generate localized heat and prevent the proliferation of LECs onto the surface of QDs-IOLs.

357;33044979;The assessment of the impact of glistening on visual performance in relation to tear film quality.;[];PloS one;"The aim of our case control study was to evaluate the impact of glistening and tear film quality on visual performance after implantation of two different hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lenses (IOLs).
In our retrospective study we included cataract patients operated between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2012, with follow-up controls between January 2016 and December 2019. Z-Flex 860FAB (Medicontur) and AcrySof IQ SN60WF (Alcon) monofocal IOLs were implanted during standard phacoemulsification. Best corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) and contrast sensitivity were monitored over the post-operative period of up to 6 years. Glistening was evaluated semi-quantitatively with slit-lamp biomicroscopy and quantitatively using Pentacam HR (Oculus). Using HD Analyzer OQAS (Visiometrics), total intraocular light diffusion was interpreted with the objective scatter index (OSI) and tear film quality was evaluated with the tear film related objective scatter index (TF-OSI).
26 eyes implanted with the Z-Flex and 25 eyes with the AcrySof IQ IOLs were included in the analysis. The slit-lamp evaluation of patients with the Z-Flex IOL (0.57 ± 0.60) revealed significantly less glistening (p<0.0001), compared to the AcrySof IQ group (1.82 ± 0.90), and these observations were confirmed by the Pentacam HR analyses, as well (Z-Flex group: 35.1 ± 1.63, Acrysof IQ: 39.6 ± 3.69, p<0.0001). TF-OSI differed between the two sets of patients remarkably (1.53 ± 1.03 vs. 2.51 ± 1.76 for AcrySof IQ and Z-Flex groups, respectively, p = 0.043). Both groups of patients provided similar results of BCDVA and contrast sensitivity.
Glistening and tear film quality both contribute to visual performance outcomes after cataract surgery.

This was a retrospective chart review of children who received secondary IOL implantation. We analyzed IOP and antiglaucoma medications before and after implantation. The latest exam with IOP measurement found within the 2-15 month period after IOL implantation was used for the postoperative data. Failure to maintain IOP control was defined as either the addition of antiglaucoma medication(s) or a rise in IOP > 4 mm Hg. Statistical analyses were performed to assess risk factors for failure to control IOP after surgery, namely age at IOL implantation, preoperative glaucoma status, and IOL fixation location.
A total of 100 eyes were included. The mean duration of follow-up was 7.74 months (SD = 3.11). Twenty-three of one hundred eyes failed to maintain IOP control according to our definition. Eyes with a history of having had a traumatic cataract (n = 3) had a more than threefold increased risk of failure (P = 0.015). Although not statistically significant, very young age at initial cataract surgery (<2 months old) had a twofold increased risk of failure compared to an older age (>12 months old) (P = 0.213).

To assess the efficacy of toric intraocular lenses (IOLs) in combined cataract and MIGS, visual and refractive outcomes were compared between eyes implanted with nontoric and toric IOLs during microhook ab interno trabeculotomy triple procedures.
Glaucomatous eyes with preexisting corneal astigmatism exceeding -1.5 D implanted with nontoric (n=10) or toric (n=10) IOLs were evaluated retrospectively. The uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) and refractive astigmatism preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively were compared.
Preoperatively, the groups had similar logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) UCVAs and refractive astigmatism. Postoperatively, the logMAR UCVA (toric, 0.07±0.07; nontoric, 0.33±0.30; P=0.0020) was significantly better and the refractive astigmatism (toric, -0.63±0.56 D; nontoric, -1.53±0.74 D; P=0.0110) significantly less in the toric group. The toric group had postoperative improvements in the logMAR UCVA (-0.58, P=0.0039) and refractive astigmatism (+1.45 D, P=0.0195).

Food and Drug Administration-approved, prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized, parallel-group, assessor-masked, confirmatory trial.
Patients enrolled were 22 years of age or older with a diagnosis of bilateral cataract with planned removal by phacoemulsification with a clear corneal incision.
Consented participants selected their preferred IOL, which was implanted sequentially into each eye of patients meeting eligibility criteria.
The coprimary effectiveness outcomes were mean photopic monocular best-corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA; 4 m) and distance-corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA; 40 cm) at 6 months after surgery. Secondary effectiveness outcomes included mean monocular distance-corrected intermediate visual acuity (DCIVA; 66 cm) and proportion of participants responding ""never"" to question 1 of the Intraocular Lens Satisfaction questionnaire (regarding frequency of spectacle use in the past 7 days). Safety outcomes included frequency of ""severe"" and ""most bothersome"" visual disturbances.
Two hundred forty-three patients underwent cataract surgery with bilateral implantation of the TFNT00 (n = 129) or SN60AT (n = 114) and were followed up for 6 months. Noninferiority of TFNT00 to SN60AT in mean photopic monocular BCDVA (95% upper confidence limit of the difference was <0.1 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR] margin), and superiority in mean photopic monocular DCNVA (difference of 0.42 logMAR; P < 0.001) and DCIVA (difference of 0.26 logMAR; P < 0.001) were demonstrated.

369;32977000;Posterior capsule opacification: What's in the bag?;['Cataract surgery', 'Fibrosis', 'Lens', 'Posterior capsule opacification', 'Stem cells', 'Tissue regeneration'];Progress in retinal and eye research;Cataract, a clouding of the lens, is the most common cause of blindness in the world. It has a marked impact on the wellbeing and productivity of individuals and has a major economic impact on healthcare providers. The only means of treating cataract is by surgical intervention. A modern cataract operation generates a capsular bag, which comprises a proportion of the anterior capsule and the entire posterior capsule. The bag remains in situ, partitions the aqueous and vitreous humours, and in the majority of cases, houses an intraocular lens (IOL). The production of a capsular bag following surgery permits a free passage of light along the visual axis through the transparent intraocular lens and thin acellular posterior capsule. Lens epithelial cells, however, remain attached to the anterior capsule, and in response to surgical trauma initiate a wound-healing response that ultimately leads to light scatter and a reduction in visual quality known as posterior capsule opacification (PCO). There are two commonly-described forms of PCO: fibrotic and regenerative. Fibrotic PCO follows classically defined fibrotic processes, namely hyperproliferation, matrix contraction, matrix deposition and epithelial cell trans-differentiation to a myofibroblast phenotype. Regenerative PCO is defined by lens fibre cell differentiation events that give rise to Soemmerring's ring and Elschnig's pearls and becomes evident at a later stage than the fibrotic form. Both fibrotic and regenerative forms of PCO contribute to a reduction in visual quality in patients. This review will highlight the wealth of tools available for PCO research, provide insight into our current knowledge of PCO and discuss putative management of PCO from IOL design to pharmacological interventions.;;;;Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

374;32958739;Traumatic Aniridia and Aphakia Management with Iris Reconstruction Lens Using Gore-Tex Sutures, an Ab-Externo Approach.;[];The American journal of case reports;BACKGROUND A safer and more delicate approach is required for the management of a post-traumatic aphakia and subtotal aniridia. CASE REPORT A 55-year-old man was referred to our clinic with symptoms of decreased vision (hand motion) and photophobia in his right eye. This patient had previously undergone pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) for the management of blunt ocular trauma in the same eye. He was being treated with topical antihypertensives, due to silicone oil-induced glaucoma. On presentation, the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in his right eye was 20/40 and the intraocular pressure (IOP) in the same eye was 20 mmHg. Slit lamp examination of his right eye showed aphakia, aniridia, and some silicone oil droplets (fish eggs) following silicone oil extraction. His corneal endothelium and thickness were within normal limits. Dilated fundoscopic examination of the right eye revealed that the retina was attached with no signs of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). An artificial iris intraocular lens (IOL) was implanted, along with 4-point scleral fixation in conjunction with Gore-Tex sutures. After 6 months, the BCVA in his right eye was 20/40 and he had no symptoms of photophobia. The IOP in that eye was 15 mmHg while on treatment with dorzolamide-timolol eye drops. No suture-related or other serious complications were observed. The patient expressed satisfaction with the functional and cosmetic results. CONCLUSIONS Modern vitrectomy combined with an artificial iris IOL and scleral fixation with Gore-Tex sutures in eyes lacking an iris and lens can provide long-term anatomic and functional restoration. Intraoperative IOP fluctuations and extra corneal damage can be avoided by lens preparation with the sutures using a small incision ab-externo approach.;;;;;10.12659/AJCR.924706;2020-09-23;[{'lastname': 'Parikakis', 'firstname': 'Efstratios', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Second Department of Ophthalmology, Ophthalmiatreio Eye Hospital of Athens, Athens, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Batsos', 'firstname': 'Georgios', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Second Department of Ophthalmology, Ophthalmiatreio Eye Hospital of Athens, Athens, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Kontomichos', 'firstname': 'Loukas', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Second Department of Ophthalmology, Ophthalmiatreio Eye Hospital of Athens, Athens, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Peponis', 'firstname': 'Vasileios', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'First Department of Ophthalmology, Ophthalmiatreio Eye Hospital of Athens, Athens, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Christodoulou', 'firstname': 'Eleni', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Ophthalmology Clinic, Corfu General Hospital, Corfu, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Karagiannis', 'firstname': 'Dimitrios', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Second Department of Ophthalmology, Ophthalmiatreio Eye Hospital of Athens, Athens, Greece.'}]

Patients who underwent cataract surgery at the Department of Ophthalmology Graz, Austria, between 1996 and 2017 were included and medical records were reviewed. Cox proportional-hazard regression models were used to assess the influence of IOL characteristics on IOL dislocation.
From 68 199 eyes out of 46 632 patients (60.2% women, mean age: 73.71 SD±10.82 years), 111 (0.16%) had an in-the-bag (ITB) disloaction and 35 (0.05%) had an out-of-the-bag (OTB) dislocation. The HRs adjusted for predisposing factors significantly associated with a higher risk for an ITB dislocation were 2.35 (95% CI, 1.45 to 3.8) for hydrophilic IOLs, 2.01 for quadripode IOLs (95% CI, 1.04 to 3.86) and 1.61 (95% CI, 1.04 to 2.48) for haptic angulation. A lower risk was observed for three-piece IOLs (HR=0.58, 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.98) and larger overall IOL diameter (HR=0.79, 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.95).

Retrospective, consecutive case series.
In this single-center study, we reviewed 136 children (199 eyes) who underwent pediatric cataract surgery before 1 year of age with a minimum of 1 year of follow-up. The intervention used was pediatric cataract surgery with IOL implantation, and the primary outcome measure was the presence or absence of secondary glaucoma.
The mean age at surgery was 148 ± 93 days (range 30-359 days) with a mean follow-up of 6.3 ± 3.6 years (range 1.1-12.8 years). Glaucoma developed in 31 eyes (16%) with 5- and 10-year incidence rates of 12% and 28%, respectively. The incidence of glaucoma seemed to be bimodal, with a first peak occurring after a mean delay of 2.5 months (range 1.6-4.1 months) and a second peak occurring after a mean delay of 5.7 years (range 2.6-11.7 years). Younger age at surgery, shorter axial length, longer follow-up, use of trypan blue, reintervention, and bilateral surgery were associatied with a higher incidence of glaucoma. Multivariate analysis including the aforementioned variables indentified longer follow-up (odds ratio [OR] = 1.3 [95% confidence interval {CI} 1.1-1.6], P = .001), reintervention (OR = 4.1 [95% CI 1.2-13.4], P = 0.02), and the use of trypan blue (OR = 4.1 [95% CI 1.3-13.1], P = .02) as predictors for the development of glaucoma.

Patients from Ethiopian cataract campaigns with available target and implanted IOL records were identified, and the diopter difference between the two was measured. Gradient descent (an ML algorithm) was used to generate an optimal IOL inventory, and we measured the models performance across varying surplus levels. Only 45.6% of patients received their target IOL power and 23.6% received underpowered IOLs with current inventory (50% surplus). The ML-generated IOL inventory ensured that more than 99.5% of patients received their target IOL when using only 39% IOL surplus. In Ethiopian cataract campaigns, most patients have avoidable postoperative refractive error secondary to suboptimal IOL inventory.

386;32906138;Effectiveness of iStent Trabecular Microbypass System Combined with Phacoemulsification versus Phacoemulsification Alone in Patients with Glaucoma and Cataract Depending on the Initial Intraocular Pressure.;['Glaucoma', 'Microinvasive glaucoma surgery', 'Trabecular microbypass stent', 'iStent'];Ophthalmic research;"To assess the effect of iStent trabecular microbypass implantation combined with phacoemulsification on intraocular pressure (IOP) and glaucoma medications and to compare this to outcomes of phacoemulsification alone in patients with mild to moderate primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) depending on initial IOP.
Eighty subjects with cataract and POAG were randomized 1:1 into either iStent implantation and cataract surgery (iStent group) (n = 44) or cataract surgery alone (control group) (n = 36). Groups were divided according to initial IOP (after washout period) into IOP <26 mm Hg and IOP ≥26 mm Hg. Patients were assessed preoperatively and at postoperative day 1, week 1, and months 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24. Outcome measures included best-corrected visual acuity, IOP, and glaucoma medications.
Postoperatively at 24 months, mean IOP decreased from 20.93 ± 1.28 to 17.79 ± 2.50 mm Hg in the IOP subgroup <26 mm Hg and from 26.00 ± 0.00 to 19.86 ± 2.19 in the subgroup ≥26 mm Hg in the control group.

PCO is due to the proliferation, migration, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of the residual lens epithelial cells (LECs) within the lens capsule. As surface topography influences cellular response, we investigated the effect of modulating the dimensions of periodic nano-textured patterns on the surface of an intraocular lens material to regulate lens epithelial cell functions such as cell adhesion, migration, orientation, and proliferation. Patterned poly(HEMA) samples were prepared by a femtosecond laser microfabrication, and the behaviors of human B-3 LECs were observed on groove/ridge patterns with widths varying from 5 to 40 µm. In the presence of ridge and groove patterns, the adherent cells elongated along the direction of the patterns, and f-actin of the cells was spread to a lesser extent on the nano-textured groove surfaces. Both single and collective cell migrations were significantly inhibited in the perpendicular direction of the patterns on the nano-textured micro-patterned samples. We also fabricated the patterns on the curved surface of a commercially available intraocular lens for in vivo evaluation. In vivo results showed that a patterned IOL could help suppress the progression of PCO by inhibiting cell migration from the edge to the center of the IOL. Our reports demonstrate that nano- and microscale topographical patterns on a biomaterial surface can regulate cellular behavior when it is implanted into animals.;;;;Copyright © 2020.

It is important to be sceptical of biometry results that do not match the refractive or clinical picture and ask for it to be repeated.
We present a unique cause of refractive surprise in a patient undergoing cataract surgery. Pre-operative refraction demonstrated hypermetropia, yet swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) biometry repeatedly calculated the axial length as > 35.00 mm in both eyes. The patient underwent phacoemulsification and intraocular lens insertion using the provided biometry calculations, however post-operatively the patient had a + 14.00 dioptre refractive surprise. Analysis of biometry performed on the same day identified other patients with exaggerated axial lengths, supporting the theory that the biometer's smeared optical surface was responsible. Following servicing of the machine, repeat biometry of the patient calculated the axial length consistent with a hypermetrope (21.67 mm) and the intraocular lens exchange was successful in correcting the refractive error.
Ensure the optical surfaces of the biometer are cleaned regularly, and consider repeating biometry on separate days if repeat biometry still is not in keeping with the refractive or clinical picture. Additionally, re-confirm the axial length with another modality.";;;;;10.1186/s12886-020-01629-0;2020-08-30;"[{'lastname': 'Carr', 'firstname': 'Francis', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': ""Department of Ophthalmology, Ashford and St Peter's Hospitals, Surrey, KT16 0PZ, UK. francis.carr@nhs.net.""}, {'lastname': 'Gangwani', 'firstname': 'Vinod', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': ""Department of Ophthalmology, Ashford and St Peter's Hospitals, Surrey, KT16 0PZ, UK.""}]"
392;32846863;Visual quality observation of clear lens extraction by ultrasonic phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation in a child with microspherophakia: A case report.;[];Medicine;"Microspherophakia is characterized by a small, spherical crystalline lens with increased sagittal diameter. Because of the uncertainty about the outcome, as well as the complexity of the operation and development of complications, the management and timing of surgical intervention for microspherophakia are still debated. Lens extraction is effective for avoiding the risk of pupillary blockage, but the outcome after operation is controversial. The iTrace (Tracey, USA) report shows the influence of low-order aberrations (LOA) and high-order aberrations (HOA), which may be valuable in predicting postoperative outcome. Our report concerns a child with microspherophakia who underwent lens extraction via the analysis of visual quality by iTrace.
Our report is on the case of a 7-year-old girl whose parents observed she had to bring her papers and books extremely close to her face to read. On examination, the girl was bilaterally diagnosed microspherophakia with a small tremble lens. The objective refraction was -15.0 diopter of spherical power (DS)/-1.00 diopter of cylindrical power (DC) × 180 right eye (OD) and -12.5 DS/-1.50 DC × 20 left eye (OS). The HOA of OD and OS were high up to 0.926 and 0.659, respectively by iTrace. The visual quality remained terrible after correcting LOA (high myopia and astigmatism). According to iTrace report, the patient would get a good visual quality by extracting the clear lens with HOA from cornea after correcting LOA. The girl's parent opted for surgery on the left eye.
Due to the patient's symptoms, examination results, she was diagnosed with microspherophakia.
The patient underwent clear lens extraction by ultrasonic phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation.
The first day after operation, total HOA was decreased to 0.077. Total LOA was 0.713. Corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) is 20/20. One week after surgery, HOA was 0.110 and LOA was 0.328. CDVA was 20/25. CDVA was still 20/25 one month after surgery. The total HOA was 0.110 and the LOA was 0.334 by iTrace.

Corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) in the left eye was 6/18, and, on examination, it showed a filtering bleb that encroached on the limbus and superior cornea. The cornea was clear with a deep anterior chamber. Retinal examination was normal. Disc cupping was noted with a cup-to-disc ratio of 0.8. Refractive correction was performed by implanting the CM-T Flex IOL. This IOL has a unique design that eliminates the need for maneuvering the IOL haptics extraocularly. It entails a simple grasp, exteriorize, and release technique that anchors the IOL firmly to the scleral bed.

407;32798525;Astigmatism Management with Intraocular Lens Surgery.;['astigmatism', 'cataract surgery', 'posterior corneal astigmatism', 'toric intraocular lenses'];Ophthalmology;Corneal astigmatism is common. More than 40% of patients undergoing cataract surgery have 1 diopter (D) power or more of astigmatism, which left untreated is visually significant. Because toric intraocular lenses (IOLs) are available, the current standard of care is to offer treatment of astigmatism at the time of cataract surgery. PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase databases, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched from inception to October 2019. Search words included astigmatism, corneal astigmatism, toric IOLs, alignment, and IOL calculation. Studies evaluated included review articles regarding the origin and history of astigmatism, the diagnosis and management of the disease, and the history of surgical management options for astigmatism. Other studies evaluated in this review included clinical trials, meta-analyses, and retrospective analysis of surgical refractive outcomes. Prediction of refractive outcomes was evaluated with a review of IOL calculators and their use in lens prediction for cataract surgery. Evaluation of these articles also showed improved uncorrected visual acuity with the use of toric IOLs in patients undergoing cataract surgery. New diagnostic technology, new toric IOLs, updated lens formulas, intraoperative guidance, and advanced imaging technology and software have contributed to improvements in the surgical correction of astigmatism.;;;;Copyright © 2020 American Academy of Ophthalmology.

In this prospective observational study, axial length, keratometry, anterior chamber depth (ACD), lens thickness, and central corneal thickness (CCT) were measured in 124 eyes of 76 patients. Intraocular lens prediction errors and absolute prediction errors were assessed based on postoperative manifest refraction. Analyses used were paired t test, Pearson correlation coefficient (r), and Bland-Altman plots.
Failure in axial length measurements was noted in 28 eyes (22.58%) with OCLR compared to 2 eyes (1.6%) with SS-OCT. Although not statistically significant, axial length measurements were clinically higher with SS-OCT (23.78 ± 1.76 mm) compared to OCLR (23.72 ± 1.58 mm) (P = .81) (r = 0.23; P = .01). There was a significant trend toward myopic intraocular lens prediction with SS-OCT (-0.09 ± 0.48) compared to OLCR (0.09 ± 0.41, P < .01) (r = 0.25, P = .01). There was good agreement for keratometric and ACD values between the two devices. SS-OCT gave significantly higher values of lens thickness compared to OCLR (4.44 ± 0.44 vs 4.18 ± 0.48 mm, P < .01) (r = 0.39, P < .01).

One-fifth of the patients with dense cataracts failed axial length measurement on OCLR. SS-OCT gives clinically higher axial length measurements leading to more myopic intraocular lens prediction errors postoperatively. OCLR provides higher pachymetry and lower lens thickness values compared to the SS-OCT device.

All records were reviewed for patients with a dislocated or subluxed scleral-sutured enVista MX60 IOL. Clinical features and outcomes were gathered. Main Outcome Measures: Clinical setting, surgical technique, complications, and visual acuity.
A total of 25 scleral-sutured enVista MX60 IOLs displacements secondary to eyelet fractures in 23 eyes of 23 patients were included. There were 20 IOLs that sustained a postoperative fracture and 5 IOLs that sustained an intraoperative fracture. Of the postoperative fractures, 7 were dislocated and 13 were subluxed. Gore-Tex was the suture of choice for 19 of the postoperative fractures and all 5 of the intraoperative fractures, and Prolene was used for 1 postoperative fracture. The mean time until postoperative fracture was 96 ± 125 days, and the median time was 61 (IQR 48-144) days. Of the postoperative fractures, new MX60s were sutured in 10 patients, and 2 of them experienced repeat displacements due to a new eyelet fracture. In the intraoperative fracture group, new MX60s were sutured in 4 patients and an Akreos AO60 lens was placed in the 5th patient. The mean preoperative best-corrected logMAR visual acuity for all patients improved from 1.2 ± 0.8 (20/317 Snellen equivalent) to 0.5 ± 0.5 (20/63 Snellen equivalent) at most recent follow-up after lens replacement.

A prospective, randomized, contralateral eye study was performed at one site in Poughkeepsie, NY, USA. Subjects included patients presenting for uncomplicated bilateral cataract surgery eligible for toric lens implantation with regular corneal astigmatism in both eyes whose toric IOL implantation was based on IA. One eye was measured when aphakic and the other when both aphakic and pseudophakic. The primary outcome measure was the magnitude of residual refractive astigmatism. Secondary measures included the percentage of eyes with 0.50D or less of residual refractive astigmatism, the spherical equivalent refraction and the time for IA measurement.
Mean residual refractive astigmatism was not statistically significantly different between groups (0.32D ± 0.46D IA_1 vs. 0.23D ± 0.35D IA_2, p = 0.25), nor was the percentage of eyes with a residual refractive cylinder of 0.50D or less (94% in both groups, p = 1.0). The average time to measure the pseudophakic eye was 3 min, 46 s. Aphakic IA measurements appeared to produce better spherical equivalent refractive results relative to preoperative calculations.

Cross-sectional study.
All patients with a Lentis LS-502-1 IOL implanted at the Department of Ophthalmology were identified. Existing medical records and information from the treating ophthalmologists were reviewed to determine the IOL status (clear or opacified). Potential risk factors were analyzed using binary logistic regression models.
A total of 223 IOLs of 199 patients were included. Sixty-seven (30.0%) opacified (calcified) IOLs were identified and compared with a control group of 156 IOLs. Statistical analyses revealed age at IOL implantation (odds ratio [OR] = 1.05, P = .012) to be associated with an increased risk of calcification. Posterior capsulotomy (OR = 0.45, P = .011) was found to have a protective influence. No other ophthalmic or systemic condition showed a significant association. Mean corrected distance visual acuity diminished significantly under opacification from 0.21 ± 0.25 logarithm of the correct minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) to 0.42 ± 0.32 logMAR (P < .001).

The TOSN happened during intraocular lens (IOL) implantation with complete vanish of blood flow in the conjunctival, episcleral and limbal vessels. Reperfusion started within 30 s and part of the blood supply of the conjunctiva and episclera was restored within 2 min. However, the blood flow in the limbal vessels was not restored until 5 min later. The postoperative examination of both eyes was normal. These two rare cases are the TOSN during cataract surgery.

Intraocular lens (IOL) delivery into the eye is a critical step in cataract surgery. Currently, eye surgeons load the IOL into the cartridge under the operating microscope or ophthalmic assistants load the IOL under their own direct vision. Because ophthalmic assistants load the IOL unaided, the IOL may be mishandled and lead to challenges such as IOL slippage, breakage, or incorrect orientation. In order to overcome these challenges and facilitate the surgical process, here we describe a novel technique by introducing a magnifier to the surgical table to aid ophthalmic assistants during this crucial step in cataract surgery. This not only saves time but also improves precision while loading IOL into the cartridge during cataract surgery.;;;;;10.4103/ijo.IJO_2217_19;2020-07-28;[{'lastname': 'Venkatesh', 'firstname': 'Rengaraj', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Aravind Eye Hospital and Post Graduate Institute of Ophthalmology, Pondicherry, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Gurnani', 'firstname': 'Bharat', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Aravind Eye Hospital and Post Graduate Institute of Ophthalmology, Pondicherry, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Kaur', 'firstname': 'Kirandeep', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Aravind Eye Hospital and Post Graduate Institute of Ophthalmology, Pondicherry, India.'}]

426;32696196;[Back-calculation of the keratometer index-Which value would have been correct in cataract surgery?];['Biometry', 'Cataract surgery', 'Gaussian linear optics', 'Keratometer', 'Paraxial optics'];Der Ophthalmologe : Zeitschrift der Deutschen Ophthalmologischen Gesellschaft;"In the clinical routine the conversion of corneal radii into corneal refractive power using a keratometer index is rarely discussed. The purpose of this study was to back-calculate the keratometer index in pseudophakic eyes based on the refractive power of the lens, biometric measurements and refraction, and to compare it to clinically established values.
In this retrospective case series 99 eyes of 99 patients without pathological alterations, previous diseases, comorbidities or history of ocular surgery apart from the uneventful cataract surgery were enrolled. In all eyes a CT Asphina 409M(P) (Carl-Zeiss Meditec, Berlin, Germany) had been implanted by two surgeons (EF and PE). For calculation we used shape and power data of the intraocular lens and data from optical biometry (axial length, pseudophakic anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, corneal radius; IOLMaster 700, Carl-Zeiss Meditec, Jena, Germany). The refraction was derived manually with a trial frame (measurement distance 5 m) and autorefractometry (iProfiler, Carl-Zeiss, Jena, Germany). For this three model eyes were used: a thin lens with the nominal refractive power positioned in the equatorial plane (model A) or in the secondary principal plane of the thick lens (model B) as well as a model considering the intraocular lens as a thick lens located at its measured position (model C).
Back-calculation of the keratometer index using vergence formulas resulted in a keratometer index based on subjective refraction measurements considering lane distance correction of 1.3307 ± 0.0026/1.3312 ± 0.0026/1.332 ± 0.0027 for model A/model B/model C, respectively. Based on objective refraction measurements (autorefraction calibrated to infinity object distances) resulted in a keratometer index of 1.3301 ± 0.0021/1.3306 ± 0.0021/1.3315 ± 0.0021, for model A/model B/model C, respectively. The keratometer index did not show any trend in linear regression for axial length or corneal radius for any of the three models or for any refraction method.
The keratometer index derived from back-calculation matched with the Zeiss index (1.332) but was much lower compared to other established indexes, e.g. the Javal index (1.3375). The missing trend for axial length or corneal radius implies that simple vergence formulas for intraocular lens refractive power calculation without correction terms or fudge factors perform best with a keratometer index slightly below 1.332, if the biometrically measured position of the intraocular lens is used as the effective lens position.
HINTERGRUND UND ZIELSETZUNG: In der klinischen Routine wird die Umrechnung von Hornhautradien in Brechwerte mit einem Keratometerindex selten hinterfragt. Ziel dieser Studie war es, bei pseudophaken Augen aus der biometrischen Vermessung, dem Linsenbrechwert sowie der Refraktion den Keratometerindex zurückzurechnen und mit etablierten Keratometerindizes zu vergleichen.
In dieser retrospektiven Fallserie wurden 99 Augen von 99 Patienten ohne Pathologien/Vorerkrankungen oder vorausgegangene operative Eingriffen mit Ausnahme der Kataraktoperation eingeschlossen, die eine CT Asphina 409M(P) (Carl-Zeiss Meditec, Berlin, Deutschland)-Intraokularlinse erhalten hatten (Operateure EF und PE). Aus der optischen Biometrie (IOLMaster 700, Carl-Zeiss Meditec, Jena, Deutschland) wurden die Augenlänge, die pseudophake Vorderkammertiefe und Linsendicke sowie der Krümmungsradius der Hornhaut entnommen. Die Refraktion wurde subjektiv mit Messbrille (Messdistanz 5 m) und Autorefraktometrie (iProfiler, Carl-Zeiss, Jena, Deutschland) erfasst. Drei Augenmodelle wurden angesetzt: dünne Linse mit nominellem Brechwert in der Äquatorebene (Modell A) oder der bildseitigen Hauptebene (Modell B der dicken Linse) und Berücksichtigung der Intraokularlinse als dicke Linse an ihrer biometrisch gemessenen Position (Modell C).
Aus der Rückrechnung des Keratometerindex auf der Basis einer Vergenzformel ergab sich auf der Basis der subjektiven Refraktion unter Berücksichtigung der Refraktionsmessdistanz für Modell A/B/C ein Wert von 1,3307 ± 0,0026/1,3312 ± 0,0026/1,3320 ± 0,0027. Mit der objektiven Refraktion (Autorefraktometer kalibriert auf Objektentfernungen in Unendlich) resultierte für Modell A/B/C ein Wert von 1,3301 ± 0,0021/1,3306 ± 0,0021/1,3315 ± 0,0021. Der Keratometerindex zeigte für alle 3 Modelle sowie für beide Refraktionsverfahren keine Abhängigkeit (lineare Regression) von der Augenlänge oder dem Hornhautradius.
Der ermittelte Keratometerindex stimmt sehr gut mit dem etablierten Zeiss-Index (1,332) überein, weicht jedoch deutlich von anderen etablierten Indizes, wie z. B. dem Javal-Index (1,3375), ab. Der fehlende Trend bezüglich Augenlänge oder Hornhautradius deutet darauf hin dass der hier ermittelte Keratometerindex von knapp unter 1,332, sich sehr gut eignet, um mit der Vergenzformel für dünne oder dicke Linsen ohne weitere Korrekturterme Intraokularlinsen zu berechnen, bei denen die effektive Linsenposition mit der physikalischen Position übereinstimmt.";The keratometer index derived from back-calculation matched with the Zeiss index (1.332) but was much lower compared to other established indexes, e.g. the Javal index (1.3375).

Intraocular lenses (IOLs) with different designs (eg. edge and body-haptics angle) and materials (acrylic hydrophobic and acrylic hydrophilic surfaces) have been studied to reduce PCO. For the prevention of endophthalmitis, intracameral injection followed or not by topical treatment with antibiotics and anti-inflammatories are usually prescribed. The objective of this work was to investigate the use of IOLs as controlled release platforms of two drugs, the antibiotic moxifloxacin (MXF) and the anti-inflammatory ketorolac (KTL) that could advantageously substitute the usual treatment. Two types of IOLs were chosen, hydrophobic and hydrophilic. Hydrophobic IOLs have shown better results in the prevention of PCO because they adhere better to the posterior capsular bag, while hydrophilic IOLs are advised in the case of patients with uveitis, glaucoma or diabetes. The IOLs were loaded with MXF + KTL and sterilized by high hydrostatic pressure. Both IOLs reduced the tendency for adhesion of LECs. In vivo tests were done to compare the concentration of the drugs in the aqueous humor obtained after eye drops administration and drug-loaded IOLs implantation. The developed IOLs were able to release MXF and KTL at therapeutic levels, in a sustained way, which contrasts with the eye drops prophylaxis. No PCO signs were detected and histological analyses demonstrated biocompatibility of these devices.;;;;Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The Effect of Intraocular Lens Choice and Capsular Tension Rings.;[];American journal of ophthalmology;"We compared rates of intraocular lens (IOL) decentration, neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet capsulotomy for posterior capsule opacification (PCO), and visual acuity (VA) in eyes with and without pseudoexfoliation (PEX) 5 years after undergoing cataract surgery.
Prospective comparative interventional study.
This multicenter study population included 1 eye of both 930 cataract patients with and 470 cataract patients without uncomplicated PEX (no small pupils or phacodonesis) all undergoing phacoemulsification by experienced Aravind Eye Care System surgeons. Eyes were randomized to either 1- or 3-piece intraocular lenses (IOLs). PEX eyes were also randomized to either receive or not receive a capsule tension ring. The main outcome measures included IOL decentration and PCO. Secondary outcomes included postoperative best-corrected VA.
Follow-up was 86.2% in the PEX group and 86.7% in the control group at 5 years. The PEX group was older (P < .001) and had more men (P = .01). IOL decentration at 5 years was equally prevalent in PEX and control eyes (1.0% vs 1.1%, respectively, P = .8). Neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet posterior capsulotomy rates for PCO were similar in the PEX group when compared with control subejcts (5.3% compared with 3.2%, respectively, P = .07). Best corrected VA was better at baseline and years 2 and 3 in the control group (P = .0001, P = .0005, and P = .02); however, there was no difference in BCVA at years 1, 4, and 5 between the PEX and control groups (P = .09, P = .29, and P = .5).
In a large-scale, long-term, prospective comparative study of cataract surgery in eyes with uncomplicated PEX, the risks of IOL decentration and PCO were low and comparable to that in control subjects.

Forty eyes with PPC undergoing phacoemulsification were evaluated. Primary outcome measure was morphology of PPC and intraoperative dynamics of posterior capsule (PC). Secondary outcome measure was PC rent, which was retrospectively compared with 72 PPC cases that underwent non-iOCT-guided surgery.
Of the 40 eyes evaluated, 3 morphological variants of PPC were observed: type I (19/40 [47.5%]) characterized by intact PC and clearance between PC and opacity, type II (12/40 [30%]) with intact PC in periphery of opacity, shadowing, and inability to detect PC in the center, and type III (9/40 [22.5%]) with dense opacity, extensive shadowing, and inability to delineate PC. In addition to hydrodelineation, hydrodissection was performed in all cases of type I PPC. In types II and III PPC, only hydrodelineation was performed. No case with type I opacity developed PC dehiscence. Three cases (7.5%) with types II (1 eye) and III (2 eyes) PPC developed PC dehiscence during aspiration of epinuclear cushion.

Most patients suffer from bilateral cataract and while cataract surgery of only one eye is effective in restoring functional vision, second-eye surgery leads to further improvements in health-related quality of life, and is cost-effective. At present, most patients undergo cataract surgery in both eyes on separate days as recommended in national guidelines, referred to as delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery (DSBCS). An alternative procedure involves operating both eyes on the same day, but as separate procedures, known as immediately sequential bilateral cataract surgery (ISBCS). The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and costs of ISBCS compared to DSBCS, in order to test the hypothesis that ISBCS is non-inferior to DSBCS in terms of effectiveness and superior to ISBCS in terms of cost-effectiveness.
Multicenter non-inferiority randomised controlled clinical trial. Patients (18 years or older) with bilateral cataract and an indication for bilateral cataract surgery with an expected uncomplicated intraoperative and postoperative course are included in the study. Patients are randomly assigned to either ISBCS or DSBCS. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with a refractive outcome in the second eye within 1.0 dioptre from the target refraction, at 4 weeks after surgery. Secondary outcomes include corrected and uncorrected distance visual acuity, complications, patient reported outcomes (PROMs), cost-effectiveness, and budget impact. Follow-up visits are planned at 1 week after first-eye surgery and 4 weeks after second-eye surgery. At 3 months after first-eye surgery, the occurrence of complications is checked and patients fill in a final questionnaire.
This study protocol describes the design of a multicenter non-inferiority randomised controlled trial. Current studies on ISBCS often lack information on safety regarding refractive outcomes. In addition, there is a lack of well-designed cost-effectiveness studies using established methods. The BICAT-NL study will provide more insight in refractive and cost-effectiveness outcomes for ISBCS compared to DSBCS.

446;32584432;Trifocal intraocular lenses versus bifocal intraocular lenses after cataract extraction among participants with presbyopia.;[];The Cochrane database of systematic reviews;"Presbyopia occurs when the lens of the eyes loses its elasticity leading to loss of accommodation. The lens may also progress to develop cataract, affecting visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. One option of care for individuals with presbyopia and cataract is the use of multifocal or extended depth of focus intraocular lens (IOL) after cataract surgery. Although trifocal and bifocal IOLs are designed to restore three and two focal points respectively, trifocal lens may be preferable because it restores near, intermediate, and far vision, and may also provide a greater range of useful vision and allow for greater spectacle independence in individuals with presbyopia.
To assess the effectiveness and safety of implantation with trifocal versus bifocal IOLs during cataract surgery among participants with presbyopia.
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2019, Issue 9); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 26 September 2019. We searched the reference lists of the retrieved articles and the abstracts from the Annual Meeting of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) for the years 2005 to 2015.
We included randomized controlled trials that compared trifocal and bifocal IOLs among participants 30 years or older with presbyopia undergoing cataract surgery.
We used standard Cochrane methodology.
We identified five studies conducted in Europe with a total of 175 participants. All five studies assessed uncorrected distance visual acuity (primary outcome of the review), while some also examined our secondary outcomes including uncorrected near, intermediate, and best-corrected distance visual acuity, as well as contrast sensitivity. Study characteristics All participants had bilateral cataracts with no pre-existing ocular pathologies or ocular surgery. Participants' mean age ranged from 58 to 64 years. Only one study reported on gender of participants, and they were mostly women. We assessed all the included studies as being at unclear risk of bias for most domains. Two studies received financial support from manufacturers of lenses evaluated in this review, and at least one author of another study reported receiving payments for delivering lectures with lens manufacturers. Findings All studies compared trifocal versus bifocal IOL implantation on visual acuity outcomes measured on a LogMAR scale. At one year, trifocal IOL showed no evidence of effect on uncorrected distance visual acuity (mean difference (MD) 0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.04 to 0.04; I
There is low-certainty of evidence that compared to bifocal IOL, implantation of trifocal IOL may improve uncorrected intermediate visual acuity at one year. However, there is no evidence of a difference between trifocal and bifocal IOL for uncorrected distance visual acuity, uncorrected near visual acuity, and best-corrected visual acuity at one year. Future research should include the comparison of both trifocal IOL and specific bifocal IOLs that correct intermediate visual acuity to evaluate important outcomes such as contrast sensitivity and quality of life.";;;;Copyright © 2020 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Iladevi Cataract & IOL Research Center, Ahmedabad, India.
Prospective, interventional case series.
Children with regular corneal astigmatism of at least 1.5 diopters (D) were included. A standardized surgical technique with in-the-bag implantation of a toric IOL was performed. All children were followed up on postoperative day 1 and periodically thereafter, until 36 months postoperatively. The uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), and residual refractive astigmatism were documented 36 months postoperatively. Rotational stability of toric IOL was also evaluated through the follow-up duration. Complications, particularly visual axis obscuration (VAO) and glaucoma, were documented.
In total, 76 eyes (51 children) were included in the study. Mean age at surgery was 7.41 ± 2.82 years (SD) and mean preoperative keratometric astigmatism was 1.56 ± 2.13 D. The CDVA (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR]) improved significantly from 0.59 ± 0.43 preoperatively to 0.23 ± 0.27 36 months postoperatively (P = .03). Mean postoperative UDVA was 0.32 ± 0.26 logMAR. Mean refractive astigmatism at final follow-up was -0.55 ± 0.40 D, with 74% patients having a UDVA of at least 20/40; 5% of eyes needed VAO treatment and none developed glaucoma. No eye required repositioning of toric IOL until final follow-up.

It is a simple, cost-effective approach to overcome the loss of accommodation with age and to become spectacles independent.
About 50 patients, where bilateral cataract extraction was indicated, were included in this study performed at the St. Joseph's Eye Hospital in Kinshasa (DR Congo). Small incision cataract surgery technique (SICS) was applied with the implantation of 6 mm PMMA lenses in the capsular bag. IOL refractive power choice was made to achieve a post-operative refraction of -0.5 dpt for the eye selected for far vision. The second eye received an implant heading for a post-operative myopia of -1.5 dpt suitable for intermediated and near vision. According to the literature, monovision criteria have been regarded as fulfilled when (a) far vision was 0.5 (logMAR) or better and (b) near vision was P3 (0.40, Decimal 32 cm) or better. Spectacle dependence after bilateral cataract surgery heading for monovision was analysed using a dedicated questionnaire.
Out of all 50 patients 22 (44%) fulfilled the above defined criteria of monovision in terms of post-operative refraction and visual acuity. About 19 out of these 22 (86.3%) patients were happy without glasses. Two of them used bifocal spectacles, whereas the remaining patient refused spectacles. About 28 patients did not fulfill monovision criteria. Out of these 28 patients, however, 9 (32.1%) of them are happy without glasses.

The NPDS group presented lower final intraocular pressure (IOP); however, more postoperative intervention and longer recovery time was required.
The aim of this study was to assess the 1-year efficacy and safety of second-generation trabecular microbypass stent implantation (iStent inject) versus NPDS in association with phacoemulsification (Phaco) for the concomitant surgical treatment of open-angle glaucoma and cataracts.
This was a single-center longitudinal retrospective comparative study of eyes treated with Phaco-NPDS, with adjunctive use of collagen matrix implant and mitomycin C (group 1), or Phaco-iStent inject (group 2). The main outcome measures were success rates [absolute success: proportion of eyes with IOP<18 mm Hg without any glaucoma medication; relative success: proportion of eyes achieving different target IOPs (<18; <15; and <12 mm Hg) with or without medication]; mean reduction (%) in IOP and medication use; number of postoperative reinterventions (goniopuncture, needling, and reoperation); and number of complications.
The mean age (y) was 69.3 in group 1 and 72.7 in group 2. Groups 1 (n=51) and 2 (n=32) achieved absolute success rates of 74.5% and 81.3%, respectively (P=0.333). Concerning relative success rates, no significant difference was found for IOP<18 mm Hg or an IOP<15 mm Hg between the 2 groups. However, significantly more eyes achieved an IOP <12 mm Hg in the Phaco-NPDS group. The mean percentage of IOP reduction from baseline to the end of follow-up was also statistically higher in group 1 (39.9% vs. 24.5%). Both groups achieved similar results in the mean reduction of medications per eye. No significant complications were found in either group, but patients in group 1 required more postoperative intervention than group 2.

454;32541369;Prevention and management of refractive prediction errors following cataract surgery.;[];Journal of cataract and refractive surgery;Patient satisfaction after modern day cataract surgery requires excellent surgical technique but increasingly demands superior refractive outcomes as well. In many cases, there exists an expectation from patients, as well as surgeons, to achieve emmetropia after cataract surgery. This is particularly true in patients electing premium intraocular lens technology to correct astigmatism and presbyopia to minimize spectacle dependence. Despite continued advances in preoperative and intraoperative diagnostics, refractive planning, and surgical technology, residual refractive error remains a primary source of dissatisfaction after cataract surgery. The need to enhance refractive outcomes and treat residual astigmatic or spherical refractive errors postoperatively becomes paramount to meeting the expectations of patients in their surgical outcome.

At 12 month, there was no statistically and visually significant changes in all controlled groups. At 18 month, 3 eyes (5.2%) from Group 2 and 1 eye (5.8%) from hydrophobic arm of Group 3 had visually significant PCO and underwent Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy. 8 eyes (10.8%) in group 1 and 3 eyes (17.6%) in hydrophilic arm of Group 3 required Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy. At 3, 6, and 12 month compared to baseline (1 month postoperatively), there was no statistically and clinically significant difference in visual acuity and subjective refraction between the groups. At 12 month, 3 patients (4%) from group 1 and 1 patient (6%) from hydrophilic arm of group 3 complained of glare sensitivity, especially in mesopic conditions. At that point, interestingly, no patient from Group 2 and hydrophobic arm of Group 3 complained about glare sensitivity. In terms of UCDVA, 68 eyes of group 1 (91%) achieved 20/20 or better distance vision, 71 eyes (96%) achieved 20/25 distance vision. In Group 2, 50 eyes (87%) achieved 20/20 or better distance vision, 52 eyes (92%) achieved 20/25 distance vision. In Group 3, 14 eyes (82%) of hydrophilic arm achieved 20/20 or better distance vision and 15 eyes (88%) achieved 20/25 distance vision. In hydrophobic arm of group 3, 16 eyes (94%) achieved 20/20 or better distance vision. UCDVA was examined with ClearChart 2 Digital Acuity System (Reichert Technologies), using Landolt C optotypes.

This study identified patients with age-related cataracts and divided them into two groups according to their anterior capsule and IOL optic relationship: total anterior capsule overlap (360°) and partial anterior capsule overlap (< 360°). Standard SS-OCT radial scanning was performed in all eyes at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after cataract surgery, respectively. The obtained photographs were used for the postoperative position measurements of capsulorhexis and IOL after three-dimensional reconstruction.
This study included 46 eyes of 34 patients: total overlap group (n = 29) and partial overlap group (n = 17). The postoperative aqueous depth significantly decreased in the first week after surgery (P < .001). The IOL tilt was greater in the partial overlap group than that in the total overlap group (P = .014). The IOL moved significantly in the first week postoperatively (both P < .001). IOL decentration in the x-axis was greater in the partial overlap group than that in the total overlap group (P = .024). The IOL and capsulorhexis both moved sharply in the first week (both P < .05). The IOL moved consistently with the capsulorhexis in the 3 months after surgery (all P > .05).
The total overlap group showed better IOL centrality and stability. IOL movement may be driven by capsular bag contraction and fibrosis.

The purpose of this study was to compare the refractive outcomes after toric intraocular lens implantation between femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery and traditional phacoemulsification.
This retrospective non-randomised case series included 114 eyes of 92 consecutive patients (59 male and 55 female) aged 71.65 ± 10.46-years (range 57 to 92-years), who underwent either femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (using two laser platforms) (group 1) or traditional phacoemulsification (group 2) between August 2013 and September 2015. Pre-operative keratometric values, the attempted refraction from the biometry platform and the toric intraocular lens web-based calculator, and the one month post-operative manifest refraction were assessed to evaluate the refractive outcomes of the two groups.

The swept-source anterior segment optical coherence tomography (SS-AS-OCT) may be a valuable diagnostic tool for the identification and estimation of the circumferential extent of cyclodialysis clefts. It could be considered an alternative when ultrasound biomicroscopy cannot be performed successfully.
The purpose of this study was to report a case of open-globe injury associated with cyclodialysis cleft and the utility of SS-AS-OCT in its diagnosis.
A 12-year-old boy presented to the clinic because of penetrating ocular trauma to his left eye with a projectile stone. He was diagnosed with limbal perforation with uveal tissue prolapse and cataract. He underwent limbal repair with cataract extraction and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation. However, even at the 6 weeks' post-operative period, he did not gain vision and had persistent hypotony with hypotonic maculopathy. Gonioscopy showed a 2-clock-hour superonasal cyclodialysis cleft. However, on SS-AS-OCT, it was discovered that the cleft extended along 5 clock hours, involving both superonasal and inferonasal quadrants. Recognizing the large extent of the cleft, endocyclopexy by modified sewing-machine technique was planned and performed. An IOP spike and improvement in vision were noted on the next post-operative day. The SS-AS-OCT confirmed cleft closure.
Although rare, cyclodialysis can occur in cases of open globe injury. The SS-AS-OCT is a useful diagnostic tool to study the circumferential extent of cyclodialysis and may unravel detachments hidden behind intact anterior ciliary body face.";;;;;10.1097/OPX.0000000000001518;2020-06-09;[{'lastname': 'Selvan', 'firstname': 'Harathy', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Glaucoma Services, Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Yadav', 'firstname': 'Suresh', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Glaucoma Services, Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Gupta', 'firstname': 'Viney', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Glaucoma Services, Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Gupta', 'firstname': 'Shikha', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]

In this way, EDOF IOLs aim to reduce photic phenomena, glare, and halos, which have been reported in MF IOLs. A potential disadvantage is a decrease of retinal image quality if the amount of the aberrations is excessively increased. Frequently, EDOF IOLs are combined with MF optical designs; for this reason, EDOF IOLs are commonly a subject of confusion with optical multifocality concepts.

However, corneal opacity is considered a relative contraindication to FLACS, as it may interfere with laser beam delivery, thus causing unpredictable capsulorhexis and lens fragmentation/liquefaction.
We present here a case with traumatic cataract and corneal opacity after laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). The patient was successfully treated using FLACS, capsular tension ring and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Posterior capsule rupture and vitreous loss were noted during the operation.

466;32501896;Update on Intraocular Lens Formulas and Calculations.;[];Asia-Pacific journal of ophthalmology (Philadelphia, Pa.);Investigators, scientists, and physicians continue to develop new methods of intraocular lens (IOL) calculation to improve the refractive accuracy after cataract surgery. To gain more accurate prediction of IOL power, vergence lens formulas have incorporated additional biometric variables, such as anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, white-to-white measurement, and even age in some algorithms. Newer formulas diverge from their classic regression and vergence-based predecessors and increasingly utilize techniques such as exact ray-tracing data, more modern regression models, and artificial intelligence. This review provides an update on recent literature comparing the commonly used third- and fourth-generation IOL formulas with newer generation formulas. Refractive outcomes with newer formulas are increasingly more and more accurate, so it is important for ophthalmologists to be aware of the various options for choosing IOL power. Historically, refractive outcomes have been especially unpredictable in patients with unusual biometry, corneal ectasia, a history of refractive surgery, and in pediatric patients. Refractive outcomes in these patient populations are improving. Improved biometry technology is also allowing for improved refractive outcomes and surgery planning convenience with the availability of newer formulas on various biometry platforms. It is crucial for surgeons to understand and utilize the most accurate formulas for their patients to provide the highest quality of care.;;;;;10.1097/APO.0000000000000293;2020-06-06;[{'lastname': 'Xia', 'firstname': 'Tina', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'John F Hardesty MD Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, St. Louis MO.'}, {'lastname': 'Martinez', 'firstname': 'Christine E', 'initials': 'CE', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tsai', 'firstname': 'Linda M', 'initials': 'LM', 'affiliation': None}]

The medical records of 6 patients, who underwent the procedure, were reviewed. In the procedure, lamellar scleral tunnels at the 2- and 8-o'clock positions were created with a microvitreoretinal blade, 1.5 mm away from the limbus. Two 27-gauge bent needles were passed, first horizontally, through these tunnels, and then vertically, which allowed them to enter the posterior chamber and to be left in position. Partial thickness trephination was made, and anterior stroma was removed where necessary. An incision was made at the 11-o'clock position, where the trephination was made, which was then extended to both sides for about 6 mm with corneal scissors. From the superior incision, the anterior haptic of a 3-piece intraocular lens was pushed through the needle at the 2-o'clock position, then the posterior haptic was pushed through the needle at the 8-o'clock position, and both haptics were removed through the sclera. Both ends were cauterized and placed into the sclera. Residual stroma was removed, and the donor graft was sutured.
At the last follow-up visit, the mean bestcorrected visual acuity was significantly increased. No serious complications were seen, with the exception of increased intraocular pressure in 3 patients.
Penetrating keratoplasty with sutureless intrasclerally fixated intraocular lens implantation can be used safely in patients with aphakia. With this technique, the globe stabilization can be maintained, and the trauma to the donor graft endothelium can be minimized.";;;At the last follow-up visit, the mean bestcorrected visual acuity was significantly increased.

An alternative method of delivery is Immediately Sequential Bilateral Cataract Surgery (ISBCS). The aim of this project was to examine the attitudes and beliefs of UK ophthalmologists towards ISBCS, explore their reasons to either practise or not practise ISBCS and identify barriers hindering its implementation in the UK.
A questionnaire was distributed to consultant members of The Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth, UK) and collected electronically. An initial screening question in regards to prior experience with ISBCS directed the rest of the survey; participants were asked to rate the importance of several factors with regards to performing ISBCS. Free text options were also available. Descriptive analysis was subsequently performed.
Of the 1357 recipients, 130 (9.6%) ophthalmologists completed the survey. Of those, 13.9% were currently performing ISBCS, 83.1% had never performed, and 3.1% had previously done so but since stopped. The main factors that acted as barriers were lack of: (1) College approval (20.5%); (2) medico-legal approval (20.2%); (3) evidence to support the use of ISBCS (16.0%); and (4) hospital approval (13.3%). Additionally, the perceived risk of complications for patients played an important role when considering ISBCS, with the risk of endophthalmitis being most feared.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes after implantation of TECNIS toric IOL in eyes with long AL and identify factors influencing their early-stage stability with preoperative corneal astigmatism.
The study population consisted of 64 eyes from 52 cataract patients, and these patients had preoperative corneal astigmatism between 1.0 and 3.7 diopters (D) and underwent phacoemulsification and TECNIS toric IOL implantation. Ophthalmic biological measurements were carried out preoperatively, including AL, anterior chamber depth (ACD), lens thickness (LT), vitreous length (VL), anterior chamber volume (ACV), sulcus-to-sulcus (STS) and keratometric value (K). Clinical examinations, including visual acuity, manifest refraction, keratometry, digital anterior segment photographs with pupillary dilation, were performed at 1 and 3 months after surgery.
The mean best corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) was improved from 0.93 ± 0.35 logarithms of the minimal angle of resolution (logMAR) preoperatively to 0.07 ± 0.10 logMAR postoperatively at 3 months after surgery. The mean residual astigmatism (RAS) was 0.91 ± 0.74D at 3 months, which was significantly decreased compared with the preoperative corneal astigmatism of 1.71 ± 0.55 D.

A 60-year-old woman presented with traumatic corneal laceration including anterior lens capsule rupture and traumatic cataract after being hit with a chestnut in the right eye. There were multiple injuries due to tiny thorns of the chestnut, including the conjunctiva, sclera, cornea, and anterior lens capsule. But no visible foreign body was detected by slit-lamp examination. Topical corticosteroid was prescribed to resolve the conjunctival inflammation induced by the thorns of chestnut, which could have caused persistent irritation. As conjunctival injection and edema being decreased during outpatient clinical follow-up, embedded conjunctival foreign body was detected and surgically removed (1st surgery). Approximately 10 weeks after the trauma, severe inflammation of the anterior segment accompanied with hypopyon developed suddenly and at the same time embedded scleral foreign body was revealed. After removal of scleral foreign body (2nd surgery), unspecified mold species was cultured from the scleral foreign body in SDA (Sabouraud dextrose agar) plate. Suspicious corneal foreign body was removed as 3rd surgery and phacoemulsification of traumatic cataract was planned as 4th surgery. Aspergillus was finally detected from removed anterior capsule and fibrotic membrane during the operation. Fungal infection resolved successfully after administration of topical (1% voriconazole and 5% natamycin) and systemic (fluconazole) antifungal agents and phacoemulsification of traumatic cataract.

An evaluation of the literature and conference data was carried out.
Currently four different types of femtolenses for capsulotomy fixation are described in the literature or are commercially available. The first described was the lens in the bag or Tassignon IOL, which was developed for secondary cataract prevention, the second was the Masket IOL for reduction of negative dysphotopsia and third the 90F designed by Dick.

IOL tilt and decentration were measured with a second-generation anterior segment optical coherence tomography (Casia2). Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to assess the association between IOL tilt and decentration with ocular biometric and systemic parameters, and the visual acuity.
A total of 196 eyes of 196 patients were enrolled in this study. IOLs showed a mean tilt of 4.8 degrees toward the inferotemporal direction, and the mean decentration was 0.21 mm. Both eyes presented a mirror symmetry relationship. Twenty-two eyes (11.22%) had a tilt greater than 7 degrees, and 21 eyes (10.72%) had a decentration more than 0.4 mm. Multivariate regression analysis showed previous pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and short axial length (AL) were associated with greater IOL tilt (P = .014 and P < .001).

Because cataract reduces light transmission and is associated with cognitive decline in older adults, we explored whether lens replacement (intraocular blue-blocking [BB] or UV-only blocking) in older patients with cataracts enhances the beneficial effects of light on procedural learning. Healthy older participants (n = 16) and older patients with post-cataract surgery (n = 13 with BB or UV lens replacement) underwent a randomized within-subject crossover laboratory design with three protocols. In each protocol, 3.5 hr dim-dark adaptation was followed by 2 hr evening blue-enriched (6,500K) or non-blue-enriched light exposure (3,000K or 2,500K), 30 min dim post-light, ~8 hr sleep and 2 hr morning dim light. Procedural learning was assessed by the alternating serial reaction time task (ASRT), as part of a larger test battery. Here, ASRT performance was indexed by type of trial (random or sequence) and sequence-specific (high or low probability) measures. During evening light exposure, we observed a significant effect of the interaction of ""group"" versus ""light condition"" on the type of trial (p = .04; p = .16; unadjusted and adjusted p-values, respectively) and sequence-specific learning (p = .04; p = .16; unadjusted and adjusted p-values, respectively), whereby patients with UV lens replacement performed better than patients with BB lens or non-cataract controls, during blue-enriched light exposure.

Fifty eyes with white cataract undergoing phacoemulsification were evaluated. The primary outcome measure was the classification of white cataract based on morphology and intraoperative dynamics on iOCT. The secondary outcome measure was rhexis-related complications.
Four types of white cataract were identified based on iOCT-type I (9 eyes), type II (3 eyes), type III (24 eyes), and type IV (14 eyes). Type I had regularly arranged lamellar cortical fibers, type II had continuous hyperreflective bands of cortical fibers with intralenticular clefts, type III had intralenticular clefts combined with areas of homogenous ground-glass appearance, and type IV had homogenous ground-glass appearance of the anterior lens cortex. Capsulorhexis in type I cataract was uneventful. In type II cataract, cortical bulge was observed in the anterior chamber on creating the initial nick, indicating raised intralenticular pressure (ILP) with an imminent risk of rhexis extension. A bimanual irrigation/aspiration was performed until lowering of ILP was observed on iOCT. In types III and IV, fluid release was observed on initiation of rhexis leading to partial (type III) or complete (type IV) lowering of ILP, with a mild-moderate risk of capsulorhexis extension. A continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis was achieved in all cases, with no case of posterior capsular tear or vitreous loss.

Relatively high Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy rates ranging from 20.3% to 33.4% were noted with four relatively older designs (high incidence of implantation between 1988 and the early 1990s). Four modern foldable lOLs manufactured from silicone and acrylic materials had significantly lower Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy rates ranging from 0.9% (Alcon Acrysof) to 17.1%. The difference in Nd:YAG rates among the eight IOL designs was found to be significant (P < 0.0001, chi-square test). Comparing foldable versus rigid designs, the foldable IOLs were associated with a much lower Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy rate (14.1% vs. 31.1%).
By use of the six factors regarding surgical technique and IOL choice described in this article, we strongly believe that the overall incidence of PCO and hence the incidence of Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy is now rapidly decreasing from rates as high as 50% in the 1980s to early 1990s. Surgical tools and IOLs are now available to bring these rates down to single digits. Careful application and use of these tools by surgeons can genuinely lead in the direction of virtual eradication of secondary cataract, the second most common cause of visual loss worldwide.";;;Relatively high Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy rates ranging from 20.3% to 33.4% were noted with four relatively older designs (high incidence of implantation between 1988 and the early 1990s).

The collapse of the anterior chamber was made by aspirating the aqueous humor in order to make curved single-plane CCI.
A retrospective study was conducted at Asai Hospital in Japan. There were 189 eyes of 132 patients scheduled from February to April 2017 for single-plane CCI. There were 175 eyes of 128 patients from February to April 2018 for curved single-plane CCI. Curved single-plane CCIs were made with aqueous humor aspiration via aqueous humor pipette, and single-plane CCIs were made without the aspiration. In case of leakage of aqueous humor from the CCI at the end of surgery, sutures were used. The main outcome measure was the proportion of sutures for CCI. Secondary outcomes included CCI length and surgically induced astigmatism (SIA) magnitude.
The proportions of suture in single-plane CCI and in curved single-plane CCIs were 25.4% (48/189) and 0% (0/175), respectively (p < 0.001).

507;32193493;Influences of the three-dimensional parameters of pterygium on corneal astigmatism and the intraocular lens power calculation.;[];Scientific reports;Pterygium morphology had great effect on corneal astigmatism and intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation in cataract patients. However, previous studies all focused on the pterygium surface parameters, the invasion degree or cross-sectional area of the pterygia into the corneal stroma were neglected. We studied the effect of three-dimensional parameters of pterygium on corneal astigmatism and IOL power prediction. We enrolled 81 eyes of 81 patients with primary nasal pterygium, measured the corneal astigmatism (Pentacam HR) and predicted IOL power change (IOLmaster500) before and after pterygium surgery. The three-dimensional parameters of pterygium (length, width, area, height and invasion cross-sectional area) were measured by slit lamp photography and Scheimpflug images. After pterygium surgery, corneal astigmatism decreased from 4.35 ± 4.24 to 1.07 ± 0.95 D and total corneal refractive power increased from 43.02 ± 1.96 to 43.95 ± 0.95 D (both P < 0.001). The predicted IOL power decreased from 22.87 ± 2.82 to 21.71 ± 2.85 D (P < 0.001) after surgery. Notably, 34 eyes (41.98%) had ≥3.0 D of pterygium induced astigmatism (PIA), and 33 eyes (40.74%) had ≥1.0 D of predicted IOL power change. PIA was independently influenced by the pterygium surface area (r = 0.43, P < 0.001) and cross-sectional area (r = 1.25, P = 0.018), while the predicted IOL power change was independently affected by the pterygium width (r = 0.70, P < 0.001). Cataract surgeons could evaluate the effects of a pterygium according to its three-dimensional parameters and prepare an optimal surgical strategy for cataract combined pterygium patients.;;;;;"10.1038/s41598-020-61959-3

Our next course of action is to place the IOL in the ciliary sulcus, however, there is a risk of IOL drop into the vitreous in cases of inadequate support. We have described a novel idea of using a suture material through the dialling hole of a three-piece rigid IOL which can be used as a leash to reduce the risk of IOL drop during implantation in such cases. This technique could also be used during sutureless scleral fixated IOL and retro-pupillary iris claw lens implantation.

Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).
Approximately 20.5% of patients undergoing cataract surgery may have macular pathologies, of which 11% may not be detected on the initial clinical examination. In the base case, an adjunctive preoperative OCT was cost effective from a third-party payer and societal perspective in the United States. In the probability sensitivity analyses, the ICURs were within the societal willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000/QALY in approximately 64.4% of the clinical scenarios.

Retrospective, consecutive case-series study.
A total of 164 eyes of 164 patients with AL ≥26.0 mm were included and divided into 2 groups: AL <28.0 mm (Group 1) and AL ≥28.0 mm (Group 2). The average arithmetic spherical equivalent prediction error (PE), mean absolute PE, median absolute error (MedAE), and the percentage of eyes within ±0.25 diopter (D), ±0.50 D, and ±1.0 D of PE were determined.
The Holladay 1 formulas showed the smallest MedAE when combined with the first linear or nonlinear version of Wang-Koch AL adjustment methods, both in total and in subgroups. The SRK/T formula displayed the highest prediction accuracy in combination with the first linear version of Wang-Koch adjustment method in total and subgroups. The CMAL reduced the absolute PE of LSF in total (P = .003) and in Group 1 (P = .017).

Thirty-one eyes of 31 patients who underwent cataract surgery with toric intraocular lens implantation were included. All patients had corneal opacity with astigmatism. Preoperative total corneal astigmatism was determined considering posterior astigmatism using a rotating Scheimpflug camera (Pentacam®: Oculus, Wetzlar, Germany). At 2 months after toric intraocular lens implantation, we evaluated residual astigmatism, uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA).
Postoperative UCVA and BCVA (0.30 ± 0.17, 0.22 ± 0.16LogMAR) were statistically improved compared to preoperative UCVA and BCVA (1.2 ± 0.34, 1.1 ± 0.30LogMAR, respectively) (P < 0.01). Postoperative residual refractive astigmatism (1.2 ± 0.35D) was statistically reduced compared to preoperative refractive astigmatism (2.4 ± 0.65D) (P < 0.05). Preoperative and postoperative total corneal astigmatism values were not statistically different. All eyes achieved postoperative visual acuity as good as or better than preoperative one.

517;32167435;Drug-loaded and Blue-ray Filtered Hydrogel as a Potential Intraocular Lens for Cataract Treatment.;['Blue-ray filtration', 'drug release', 'hydrogel', 'indomethacin', 'intraocular lens', 'polyacrylate'];Pharmaceutical nanotechnology;"Indomethacin (IND) is a class of non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs, which is used to treat various kinds of ocular inflammation, and has been reported to prevent posterior capsule opacification (PCO) by inhibiting the mitosis and collagen synthesis of human lens epithelial cells (LECs). In addition, the specific absorption spectrum of indomethacin shows the effect of absorbing short-wavelength blue-violet light.
We prepared an indomethacin-loaded hydrogel as a potential intraocular lens (IOLs) material to prevent endophthalmitis, PCO and filter harmful blue light.
Indomethacin prodrugs (HEMA-IND) (HI) were prepared by esterification of indomethacin and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), and poly (HEMA-co-MAA-co-MMA-co- HI) (HAMI) hydrogels were prepared by free-radical polymerization of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), methyl methacrylate (MMA), methacrylic acid (MAA) and HI. The physical and chemical properties of obtained hydrogel were detected, including optical, morphology, thermomechanical and surface properties, equilibrium water content, drug release behaviors and cytotoxicity.
HAMI hydrogels can filter harmful short-wavelength blue light and show other necessary properties like visible light transparency, glass transition temperatures, mechanical strength, and biocompatibility for making intraocular lenses. Meanwhile, MAA increases the hydrophilicity of the hydrogels, resulting in a lower water contact angle and controllable drug release from the hydrogels.
In summary, HAMI hydrogels show a great potential as IOL biomaterials that can maintain the sustained release of indomethacin and filter harmful blue light after cataract surgery. Lay Summary: People with cataract surgery can be at high risk of postoperative complications, such as PCO and postoperative endophthalmitis. Moreover, early IOLs allowed all ultraviolet (UV) and visible light to pass through retina without restriction, thus to damage the retina and the retinal pigment epithelium, which may lead to retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Herein, we sought to design and prepare a kind of IOLs loaded with indomethacin to mitigate those postoperative complications and filter harmful blue light to improve the treatment prognosis.";In summary, HAMI hydrogels show a great potential as IOL biomaterials that can maintain the sustained release of indomethacin and filter harmful blue light after cataract surgery.

However, there is no consensus in the literature about which of these 2 methods is safer and better. The authors performed a literature review searching the main postoperative outcomes obtained with the use of each surgical method. Scleral and iris fixation of IOL are efficient in correction of the patients' visual acuity, even though each technique presents distinct complications which depend especially on the experience of the surgeon with the performed surgical method. It is important to understand that individuals submitted to scleral or iris fixation present previous preoperative complications in their eyes. Besides, both procedures are very complex, involving intense manipulation of the eye globe. The success rate of these surgical techniques is highly variable and has a close relation to the preoperative conditions of the patient's eye and the improvement of the surgeon's learning curve.;;;;© 2020 S.

Prospective, nonrandomized, comparative, observational study.
Sixty eyes of 60 patients who underwent 25-gauge phacovitrectomy without gas injection for macular pathology and 60 eyes of 60 patients who underwent phacoemulsification alone for cataract were enrolled.
Preoperative optical biometry was performed using the IOLMaster 700 (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc, Dublin, CA) to calculate the IOL power with the Barrett Universal II formula. Monofocal, nontoric, single-piece foldable aspherical IOLs were implanted in each patient. Comprehensive ocular examinations, including CASIA2 (Tomey Corp, Nagoya, Japan) evaluations of the preoperative crystalline lens and postoperative IOL positions (i.e., decentration, tilt, and aqueous depth), were performed before and 3 days, 1 month, and 3 months after surgery.
Refractive prediction errors and IOL dynamics.
Mean refractive prediction errors at 3 days, 1 month, and 3 months after phacovitrectomy were 0.51±0.59 diopters (D), 0.11±0.40 D, and 0.05±0.41 D, respectively, whereas those after phacoemulsification alone were 0.43±0.38 D, 0.11±0.37 D, and 0.07±0.34 D, respectively. There was no significant difference in the refractive error between the 2 groups at any time point.

524;32134436;Effects of Cataract Surgery on Melatonin Secretion in Adults 60 Years and Older: A Randomized Clinical Trial.;[];JAMA ophthalmology;"Cataract surgery, which increases perception of light, may increase melatonin secretion. Melatonin secretion has been associated with depression, diabetes, cognitive impairment, and breast cancer. To date, no evidence from a randomized clinical trial exists to support this cataract surgery hypothesis.
To determine whether cataract surgery modifies the melatonin secretion at 3 months after cataract surgery in 169 adult patients.
A parallel-group randomized clinical trial was conducted at a single referral center from July 1, 2014, to June 30, 2017. Data were analyzed from January 1, 2018, to March 31, 2019. Patients were aged 60 years or older, had no history of cataract surgery, and had cataracts with grade 2 or higher nuclear opacifications based on the Lens Opacities Classification System III. Analyses were based on intention to treat.
Patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive cataract surgery using artificial clear intraocular lens (IOL) or yellow IOL. Group 1 received prompt surgery with clear IOL, group 2, prompt surgery with yellow IOL, group 3, delayed surgery with clear IOL, and group 4, delayed surgery with yellow IOL. The intervention group consisted of groups 1 and 2, and the control group consisted of groups 3 and 4.
Urinary melatonin excretion in the intervention group was measured at 3 months after surgery, and urinary melatonin excretion in the control group was measured before delayed surgery.
Of the 169 randomized patients, 97 were men (57.4%). The mean (SD) age was 75.7 (6.7) years. Mean urinary melatonin excretion was calculated as standardized urinary concentration, the ratio of urinary concentration to urinary creatinine concentration (nanograms per milligram of creatinine), in the intervention group after cataract surgery. Mean urinary melatonin excretion was significantly higher than in the control group (adjusted mean difference of creatinine concentration, 0.159 log ng/mg, 95% CI, 0.045-0.273; P = .007) independent of baseline urinary melatonin excretion and potential confounders. Subgroup analysis comparing group 1 with group 3 revealed that concentration of urinary melatonin excretion in patients who received clear IOLs was higher than the control group by creatinine concentration 0.212 log ng/mg (95% CI of the difference, 0.058-0.365; P = .008). However, the difference between patients in group 2 and group 4 was not significant (adjusted mean difference for creatinine excretion, 0.083 log ng/mg, 95% CI, -0.087 to 0.253; P = .33). The difference of concentration of mean urinary melatonin excretion between patients in group 1 and those in group 2 was not significant (95% CI of the difference for creatinine concentration, -0.19 to 0.40 log ng/mg; P = .48).
The findings in this study support the hypothesis that cataract surgery increases melatonin secretion. The effect of clear IOLs vs yellow IOLs on these outcomes was not shown to be different.

This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of an intracameral combination of 2 mydriatics and 1 anesthetic (ICMA, Mydrane) for cataract surgery in patients with well-controlled type-2 diabetes.
Post-hoc subgroup analysis of a phase 3 randomized study, comparing ICMA to a conventional topical regimen. Data were collected from 68 centers in Europe and Algeria. Only well-controlled type-2 diabetics, free of pre-proliferative retinopathy, were included. The results for non-diabetics are also reported. The primary efficacy variable was successful capsulorhexis without additional mydriatic treatment. Postoperative safety included adverse events, endothelial cell density and vision.
Among 591 randomized patients, 57 (9.6%) had controlled type 2 diabetes [24 (42.1%) in the ICMA Group and 33 (57.9%) in the Topical Group; intention-to-treat (ITT) set]. Among diabetics, capsulorhexis was successfully performed without additional mydriatics in 24 (96.0%; modified-ITT set) patients in the ICMA Group and 26 (89.7%) in the Topical Group. These proportions were similar in non-diabetics. No diabetic patient [1 (0.5%) non-diabetics] in the ICMA Group had a significant decrease in pupil size (≥3 mm) intraoperatively compared to 4 (16.0%; modified-ITT set) diabetics [16 (7.3%) non-diabetics] in the Topical group. Ocular AE among diabetics occurred in 2 (8.0%; Safety set) patients in the ICMA Group and 5 (16.7%) in the Topical Group. Endothelial cell density at 1 month postoperatively was similar between groups in diabetics (P = 0.627) and non-diabetics (P = 0.368).
ICMA is effective and can be safely used in patients with well-controlled diabetes, with potential advantages compared to a topical regimen including reduced systemic risk, better corneal integrity and reduced risk of ocular complications.

Optic capture after intrascleral haptic fixation.;[];Journal of cataract and refractive surgery;A 45-year-old man was originally referred for management of spontaneous subluxation of the inferior haptic of a 3-piece intraocular lens (IOL) into the anterior chamber of the right eye (). He had a significant past ocular history of laser-assisted laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) in both eyes, pars plana vitrectomy/scleral buckle for retinal detachment repair in the right eye, and pseudophakia in both eyes. The corrected distance visual acuity was 20/200 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. Of note, he had severe iridodonesis, a 2+ pigmented cell in the anterior chamber without significant pseudophacodonesis and the posterior capsule was intact with striae. The referring physician attempted a refixation surgery that failed, and the patient was ultimately left aphakic.Next, a secondary 3-piece posterior chamber (PC) IOL (CT Lucia 602, Carl Zeiss Meditec AG) was fixated with the Yamane flanged intrascleral haptic fixation technique (ISHF). A surgical peripheral iridotomy (PI) was made with the vitrector to avoid pupillary capture postoperatively.On postoperative day 1 the patient had a well-centered PC IOL and uncorrected distance visual acuity (UCVA) of 20/30. However, on postoperative day 14 the patient complained of decreased vision as the UCVA dropped to 20/100 and pupillary capture of the optic was noted. In addition, there was a 3+ pigmented cell in the anterior chamber, pigment dusting on the anterior surface of the PC IOL, and an intraocular pressure (IOP) of 32 mm Hg ().What additional testing would you consider?

Centre For Sight Group of Eye Hospitals, a chain of tertiary eyecare hospitals in India.
Prospective interventional case series.
The study included eyes with PPCs undergoing FLACS using the CATALYS femtosecond platform. Real-time OCT guidance was used to image the posterior capsule (PC), which was then classified as intact or dehiscent. The femtosecond laser was used for the creation of capsulotomy, nuclear fragmentation, and corneal incisions. In all eyes, the posterior offset (distance between the posterior extent of nucleotomy and the PC) was increased to enable a thick epinuclear cushion. Intraoperative status of the PC was noted, and the specificity and the sensitivity of AS-OCT to detect a preexisting posterior capsular defect was determined.
The cohort included 50 eyes (40 patients), in which a posterior capsular discontinuity on AS-OCT was observed in 7 eyes (14%). Five (10%) of these 7 eyes developed an intraoperative posterior capsular rent (PCR) A sensitivity and negative predictive value of 100% was noted. No case of nucleus drop was noted.

The following is an ex vivo comparison of PCO between the Clareon vs. the AcrySof IOL in human capsular bags.
Twenty cadaver capsular bags from 10 human donors were used, with the novel hydrophobic IOL (Clareon, CNA0T0) being implanted in one eye and the other eye of the same donor receiving the AcrySof IOL (SN60WF) following phacoemulsification cataract surgery. Five capsular bags of 3 donors served as controls without IOL. Cellular growth of lens epithelial cells was photo-documented daily. The primary endpoint was the time until full coverage of the posterior capsule by cells. Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining of capsular bags for the fibrotic markers f-actin, fibronectin, alpha smooth muscle actin, and collagen type 1 were performed.

Fifty-five eyes of 43 patients who had undergone phacoemulsification and IOL implantation were included in the analysis. They had some risk of zonular weakness, such as pseudoexfoliation, shallow anterior chamber, high myopia, and phacodonesis, or were judged to have unstable zonules during surgery. Toric IOL was implanted in 9 eyes with CTR and 22 eyes without CTR, while multifocal IOL was used in 9 eyes with CTR and 15 eyes without CTR. Manifest refraction, refractive astigmatism, visual acuity, and degree of IOL decentration and tilt measured using swept-source anterior segment optical coherence tomography were analyzed. Axis misalignment of toric IOLs were also evaluated.
In toric IOLs, co-implantation of CTR significantly reduced decentration and axis misalignment of IOL, resulting in better uncorrected and corrected visual acuity after surgery. In multifocal IOLs, combined use of CTR significantly prevented IOL tilt, leading to better intermediate visual acuity. Spherical equivalent and residual astigmatism were not significantly affected by the use of CTR.

To compare long-term visual outcomes with contact lens vs IOL correction following unilateral cataract surgery during infancy.
This multicenter randomized clinical trial enrolled 114 infants with a unilateral congenital cataract who underwent cataract surgery with or without primary IOL implantation between 1 and 6 months of age.

Intraocular lens implantation at the time of cataract surgery.
Best-corrected visual acuity using the electronic Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (E-ETDRS) testing protocol. Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis.
Best-corrected visual acuity was measured at age 10.5 years for 110 of the 114 patients (96%) enrolled as infants. The participants included 58 girls (53%) and 52 boys (47%). Overall, 27 of the children (25%) had good (logMAR 0.30 [Snellen equivalent, 20/40] or better) visual acuity in the treated eye (12 [22%] in the IOL group and 15 [27%] in the aphakia group), but 50 children (44%) had a visual acuity of logMAR 1.00 (Snellen equivalent, 20/200) or worse (25 [44%] in the IOL group and 25 [44%] in the aphakia group). The median logMAR acuity in the treated eye was similar in children randomized to receive an IOL at the time of cataract extraction (0.89; interquartile range [IQR], 0.33-1.43 [Snellen equivalent, 20/159]) and those who remained aphakic (0.86; IQR, 0.30-1.46 [Snellen equivalent, 20/145]) (IQR, 0.30-1.46; P = .82). Although the overall difference in median visual acuity between the 2 groups was small, the estimate was imprecise (99% CI for the difference in medians was -0.54 to 0.47).
As in previous phases of the study, visual acuity outcomes were highly variable with only 27 children (25%) achieving excellent visual acuity in their treated eye and 50 children (44%) having poor vision in the treated eye. Implanting an IOL at the time of cataract extraction was neither beneficial nor detrimental to the visual outcome.

Eighty-eight highly myopic eyes of 88 patients after uneventful cataract surgery were included, 31 of which had early postoperative IOP elevation and 57 of which did not. The morphologic features of the Schlemm canal and trabecular meshwork, collected with swept-source optical coherence tomography before surgery, were reviewed. Backwards stepwise multiple linear regression was used to investigate the anatomic risk factors for early IOP elevation in highly myopic eyes.
Highly myopic eyes with early postoperative IOP elevation had smaller Schlemm canal vertical diameter and area, as well as smaller trabecular meshwork thickness and width, in each quadrant than the non-elevation group. There was no significant difference in Schlemm canal horizontal diameter between the IOP elevation and non-elevation groups. In the highly myopic eyes, average Schlemm canal vertical diameter, Schlemm canal area, trabecular meshwork thickness, and width were all correlated negatively with the IOP elevation. A multivariate analysis showed that average Schlemm canal vertical diameter (β = -0.262, P = .004) and trabecular meshwork thickness (β = -0.173, P < .001) were significantly associated with early transient IOP elevation in highly myopic cataract eyes.

Nonrandomized interventional case series of 34 eyes of 17 children (<15 years of age) who underwent pars plana lensectomy (PPL) and GIOL surgery between January 2013 and December 2016. Eyes with surgical PI (January 2013-June 2015) were compared with those without surgical PI (July 2015-December 2016). The primary outcome measure of the role of surgical PI in GIOL surgery was to account for complications such as optic capture, secondary glaucoma, intraocular lens (IOL) dislocation, or repeat surgery. The secondary outcomes were changes in the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA).
The mean age at surgery was 8.8 years (range: 3.5-15 years). Surgical PI was conducted in 15 eyes. Among the 19 eyes without PI, 9 eyes had complications (optic capture -6; rise in IOP -4; IOL subluxation -4; repeat surgery -5). The complications were significantly less in the PI group, P = 0.02. There was a statistically significant improvement in BCVA (P = 0.0001) in all the patients.

Her ocular history included retinal detachment repair in each eye, 9 years earlier in the right eye and 7 years earlier in the left eye. Although the patient did not remember specific details of the retinal surgery, she recalled that she had a ""gas bubble"" postoperatively in the right eye, but not the left eye. She also had a very dense nuclear cataract in the right eye, but only mild nuclear sclerosis in the left eye.At presentation, the patient's corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) was 20/125 in the right eye, with a large myopic shift (-18.25 + 2.00 × 175). Her CDVA in the left eye was 20/20 (-11.00 + 1.00 × 20). It is notable that she is contact lens-intolerant.Her angle was wide open in each eye, and each optic nerve had severe myopic saucerization and cupping. The axial length was 28.5 mm and 28.7 mm in the right eye and left eye, respectively.The intraocular pressure (IOP) at presentation was 18 mm Hg in the right eye and 20 mm Hg in the left eye; each eye was treated with a topical β-blocker, α-2 agonist, and a prostaglandin. The highest IOP measurements before treatment were 27 mm Hg and 25 mm Hg in the right eye and left eye, respectively.

It is noteworthy that intraoperatively, the right capsular bag was very loose. Indeed, the capsular bag could not be penetrated with the cystotome, which only dimpled the capsule severely but would not penetrate it. Accordingly, a super-sharp, #15 blade was used to pierce the capsule and initiate the capsulotomy.Whereas the zonule was obviously loose, the remainder of the procedure was completed without incident and the intraocular lens (IOL) placed in the capsular bag with perfect centration. It was unclear whether the loose zonule was a consequence of the patient's vitreoretinal surgery or whether there was a systemic cause for her zonulopathy. Although it was not suspected before the surgery, in retrospect, this patient had the classic body habitus of Marfan syndrome. Moreover, subsequent surgery in the fellow left eye found the zonule to be quite loose, but not as severe as in the right eye.How would you manage this patient's glaucoma? Given the finding of very loose zonular fibers, would you initiate a workup for Marfan syndrome? Certain microinvasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) procedures are labeled for mild-to-moderate glaucoma. How strictly do you adhere to such labeling?

We performed phacoemulsification cataract removal on 401 patients. We randomly assigned these patients into three groups: the standard setting (Group I, n = 134), with reduced vacuum and flow rate (Group II, n = 137), and with IOL insertion before the last quadrant was emulsified with standard setting (Group III, n = 130). The primary outcomes included the risk of posterior capsular rupture (PCR), ultrasound time, energy, and complications. The secondary outcomes included central corneal thickness (CCT), CCT changes, endothelial cells (ETC) counting, ETC loss, and the best corrected distance visual acuity (BCVA) measured on day 1, day 7 and day 30. If PCR occurred, we emulsified the residual lens materials after insertion of IOL and clean of the prolapsed vitreous. We found that the risk of PCR in Group III (0/130) was lower than Group I (9/134, corrected relative risk (RR) = 18.44, 95% CI: 1.08-313.56) and Group II (3/137, corrected RR = 6.64, 95% CI: 0.35-27.41).

553;31987642;Outcomes of Bilateral Cataracts Removed in Infants 1 to 7 Months of Age Using the Toddler Aphakia and Pseudophakia Treatment Study Registry.;[];Ophthalmology;"To evaluate outcomes of bilateral cataract surgery in infants 1 to 7 months of age performed by Infant Aphakia Treatment Study (IATS) investigators during IATS recruitment and to compare them with IATS unilateral outcomes.
Retrospective case series review at 10 IATS sites.
The Toddler Aphakia and Pseudophakia Study (TAPS) is a registry of children treated by surgeons who participated in the IATS.
Children underwent bilateral cataract surgery with or without intraocular lens (IOL) placement during IATS enrollment years 2004 through 2010.
Visual acuity (VA), strabismus, adverse events (AEs), and reoperations.
One hundred seventy-eight eyes (96 children) were identified with a median age of 2.5 months (range, 1-7 months) at the time of cataract surgery. Forty-two eyes (24%) received primary IOL implantation. Median VA of the better-seeing eye at final study visit closest to 5 years of age with optotype VA testing was 0.35 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR; optotype equivalent, 20/45; range, 0.00-1.18 logMAR) in both aphakic and pseudophakic children. Corrected VA was excellent (<20/40) in 29% of better-seeing eyes, 15% of worse-seeing eyes. One percent showed poor acuity (≥20/200) in the better-seeing eye, 12% in the worse-seeing eye. Younger age at surgery and smaller (<9.5 mm) corneal diameter at surgery conferred an increased risk for glaucoma or glaucoma suspect designation (younger age: odds ratio [OR], 1.44; P = 0.037; and smaller cornea: OR, 3.95; P = 0.045). Adverse events also were associated with these 2 variables on multivariate analysis (younger age: OR, 1.36; P = 0.023; and smaller cornea: OR, 4.78; P = 0.057). Visual axis opacification was more common in pseudophakic (32%) than aphakic (8%) eyes (P = 0.009). Unplanned intraocular reoperation occurred in 28% of first enrolled eyes (including glaucoma surgery in 10%).
Visual acuity after bilateral cataract surgery in infants younger than 7 months is good, despite frequent systemic and ocular comorbidities. Although aphakia management did not affect VA outcome or AE incidence, IOL placement increased the risk of visual axis opacification. Adverse events and glaucoma correlated with a younger age at surgery and glaucoma correlated with the presence of microcornea.";;;"One hundred seventy-eight eyes (96 children) were identified with a median age of 2.5 months (range, 1-7 months) at the time of cataract surgery.

In this retrospective analytical interventional study, medical records of children younger than 17 years who underwent surgical membranectomy with anterior vitrectomy via a limbal approach were analyzed. Time lag for PCO formation after cataract surgery was assessed. Any adverse events during surgery, rate of successful completion of membranectomy, postoperative complications, improvement in visual acuity, and intraocular lens (IOL) centration were recorded.
A total of 60 eyes of 58 children were included: 26 had traumatic etiology and 34 had developmental cataract. Mean time duration for PCO formation was 27.83 ± 39.83 months for traumatic cases and 53.53 ± 52.20 months for developmental cataract (P = .04). A satisfactory opening in the center of the membrane was achieved in 47 cases (n = 47, 78.3%). The complications encountered were uveitis (5 eyes), corneal edema (3 eyes), pigment deposition over IOL (2 eyes), raised intraocular pressure (1 eye), IOL drop (1 eye), and broken haptic (1 eye).

All studies collected data on distance and near visual acuity but there was considerable variation in the measures used and whether these outcomes were unaided or best corrected.

Setting: Department of Ophthalmology, Medical University, Vienna, Austria.
Children aged 0-18 years who received cataract extraction owing to a unilateral or bilateral cataract between January 2003 and December 2018 were included. Main Outcomes and Measures: Information regarding the type and duration of surgery and total anesthesia time were recorded. Additionally, intraoperative and postoperative complications including retreatments were evaluated.
A total of 220 eyes of 147 patients were included in this analysis (US-Cat: n = 74 patients; BS-Cat: n = 63 patients; BT-Cat: n = 10 patients). The mean age at surgery was 15.94 ± 27.10 months in the US-Cat group, 33.47 ± 58.20 months in the BS-Cat group, and 41.91 ± 55.09 months in the BT-Cat group. The main surgical approach was lensectomy combined with anterior vitrectomy ± IOL implantation (US-Cat: 98.65%; BS-Cat: 95.24%; BT-Cat: 100%; P = .08). Initial intraocular lens implantation was not commonly performed in all groups (US-Cat: 27.03%; BS-Cat: 23.02%; BT-Cat: 50.00%). The mean anesthesia time was shortest in the US-Cat (91.62 ± 26.12 min), followed by the BS-Cat (123.81 ± 30.11 min) and BT-Cat groups (186.00 ± 42.34 min; P < .001), contrary to the duration of surgery (US-Cat: 37.56 ± 15.69 min; BS-Cat: 32.33 ± 17.31 min; BT-Cat: 37.50 ± 18.67; P = .087).

Patients with epiretinal membrane or macular hole who underwent combined phacovitrectomy (group 1) or phacoemulsification following pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) (group 2) were included in this retrospective, comparative, interventional case series. The primary outcome measures were the intraocular lens power prediction error (PE) and the percentage of eyes with PE > ± 0.5D in the two groups. Secondary outcome measures included the correlation between epidemiological, clinical, or surgical factors and dioptric shift. In addition, the influence of optical coherence tomography characteristics to the PE was investigated.
Group 1 and 2 consisted of 55 and 54 eyes, respectively, for a total of 109 eyes included in the study. The mean absolute PE was 0.59 D (range + 1.4 to - 2.5D) in group 1 and 0.35 (range + 1.0 to - 1.45D) in group 2 (p = 0.01). PE greater than 0.5D was observed in 47% of eyes in group 1 as opposed to 16.6% of eyes in group 2 (p = 0.027). The PE was associated with shallower anterior chamber depth (ACD), increased central macular thickness (> 300 μ), and worse baseline best-corrected visual acuity.

Common complications related to IOL fixation techniques were as follow: anterior chamber IOL: transient/permanent corneal oedema (9-66.6%), uveitis (1.1-39.3%); iris-fixated IOL: pupil ovalization (16-47.7%); and sutured scleral-fixated IOL: suture breakage/exposure (6.1-11%), vitreous haemorrhage: (5.5-16.6%). In our retrospective case series, indications for surgery were postoperative aphakia in 50 eyes (49%), IOL dislocation in 38 eyes (37%) and natural lens dislocation in 15 eyes (14%). Scleral tunnels for haptic fixation were created with (28 eyes, 27.2%) or without (75 eyes, 72.8%) 25 gauge trocar cannulas. Complications included transient hypotony (n = 20; 19.4%), corneal decompensation (n = 7; 6.7%), IOL dislocation (n = 6; 5.8%), cystoid macular oedema (n = 5; 4.8%), vitreous haemorrhage (n = 4; 3.8%) and retinal detachment (n = 4; 3.8%). Mean best corrected visual acuity improved from logMAR 0.65 to 0.36 at the final visit (p = 0.001). In conclusion, SIS fixation provides good anatomical and functional outcomes; however, complications can occur. The number of surgical approaches for IOL dislocation described in the literature indicates that optimal treatment remains to be found.";;;;© 2019 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

581;31745327;The human capsular bag model of posterior capsule opacification.;[];Eye (London, England);"Posterior capsule opacification (PCO) is the most common complication following cataract surgery and affects millions of patients. PCO is a consequence of surgical injury promoting a wound-healing response. Following surgery, residual lens epithelial cells grow on acellular regions of the lens capsule, including the central posterior capsule. These cells can undergo fibrotic changes, such that cell transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts, matrix deposition and matrix contraction can occur, which contribute to light scatter and the need for further corrective Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy in many patients. It is therefore of great importance to better understand how PCO develops and determine better approaches to manage the condition. To achieve this, experimental systems are required, and many are available to study PCO. While there may be a number of common features associated with PCO in different species, the mechanisms governing the condition can differ. Consequently, where possible, human systems should be employed. The human capsular bag model was established in a laboratory setting on donor eyes. A capsulorhexis is performed to create an opening in the anterior capsule followed by removal of the lens fibre mass. Residual fibre cells can be removed by irrigation/aspiration and if required, an intraocular lens can be implanted. The capsular bag is isolated from the eye and transferred to a dish for culture. The human capsular bag model has played an important role in understanding the biological processes driving PCO and enables evaluation of surgical approaches, IOLs and putative therapeutic agents to better manage PCO.

Primary end-point was superiority or non-inferiority of modified IOL scleral fixation compared with normal IOL scleral fixation for visual acuity (VA). Changes in corneal endothelium cell number, refractivity, astigmatisms and surgery-related complications, were secondary end-points.
There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between groups. Raw VA and best collected VA (BCVA) were significantly improved in all eyes (p-). There were no statistical significances in raw VA, BCVA and surgery-related complications between groups.
Results of the modified technique were not inferior compared with the original technique although it was less invasive. Therefore, flanged IOL fixation via trocars using a double-needle technique is a useful technique for IOL implantation.";;;There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between groups.

Between 2014 and 2017, 65 eyes of 65 patients diagnosed with 3-piece IOL dislocation were treated with scleral fixation, and their records were retrospectively evaluated. Our patients were divided into two groups based on the treatment - exchange (Group 1) and refixation (Group 2). Dislocated IOL removal and new IOL insertion was performed with scleral fixation in group 1, and in group 2, scleral fixation of the dislocated intraocular lens performed without removal. Visual results, intraoperative and postoperative complications and lens induced astigmatism secondary to scleral fixation were compared between two groups.
Patients in both groups were followed for an average of 13.62±3.4 months. Twenty-six patients were in group 1 and 39 patients were in group 2. All of the scleral fixation lenses were 3-pieced. Increased visual acuity was observed in both groups, and no difference was detected between the two groups (P˂0.01). Intraocular lens-induced astigmatism was similar in both groups (P=0.68). Intraocular hemorrhage as an intraoperative complication was seen in two patients in group 1 and one patient in group 2. Redislocation in three patients in group 2 and cystoid macular edema in one patient in each groups were observed.

Consecutive patients treated with phacoemulsification were recruited. IOP was measured before and 1 day, 3 days, 1 week and 3 months after surgery. Axial length (AL) and anterior chamber depth (ACD) were recorded, and optic disc tilt, rotation and beta-zone peripapillary atrophy (β-PPA) were measured from fundus photographs taken 1 week after surgery. Backward stepwise multiple linear regression was used to investigate the risk factors for early transient IOP spike in the HMC group.
Finally, 94 eyes of 94 HMC patients and 67 eyes of 67 age-related cataract (ARC) controls were included in analysis. The incidence of early IOP spike was 10% in the ARC group and 28% in the HMC group (OR=3.277, p<0.05) at 1 day after surgery.

The purpose of this study was to compare long-term clinical outcomes of phacoemulsification versus phacotrabeculectomy in PACG eyes with cataract.
The 2 initial prospective randomized controlled trials recruited PACG eyes with cataract using the same criteria and randomized these eyes to receiving either phacoemulsification or phacotrabeculectomy. Clinical data up to 5 years of follow-up were pooled for retrospective analysis.
Clinical data of 35 patients in the phacoemulsification group and 44 patients in the phacotrabeculectomy group were analyzed. At 5 years after surgery, the mean IOP was decreased by 20.7% and 29.5% from before surgery to 5 years after phacoemulsification and phacotrabeculectomy, respectively (P<0.001 for both groups). Phacotrabeculectomy was significantly more effective than phacoemulsification in reducing IOP up to 5 years after surgery (P<0.001).

Pediatric patients who have undergone surgery for congenital or infantile cataracts have a risk of developing suspected glaucoma and glaucoma, but the current evidence does not address our understanding of the incidence and associated risk factors of suspected glaucoma/glaucoma for application in clinical standard care. Therefore, this study investigated the incidence of and risk factors for suspected glaucoma/glaucoma in patients who have undergone surgery for congenital/infantile cataracts.
This study used a prospective cohort of 241 eyes from 241 patients who were 10 years of age or younger and who had undergone congenital/infantile cataract surgeries and were recruited from January 2011 to December 2016 at the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center. Pediatric patients who underwent cataract surgery were classified into 2 groups according to intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. The patients' baseline characteristics and the incidence and risk factors for suspected glaucoma/glaucoma were assessed.
The incidence of suspected glaucoma after cataract surgery was 10.70% [26 of 241 eyes; 95% confidence interval (CI), 6.88%-14.70%]. The rate of suspected glaucoma developing into glaucoma was 26.92% (7 of 26 eyes; 95% CI, 9.87%-43.97%), and the incidence of glaucoma was 2.90% (7 of 241 eyes; 95% CI, 0.79%-5.03%). Our study revealed that the incidence of suspected glaucoma/glaucoma in patients who did not receive IOL implantation was 13.91% (21 of 151 eyes; 95% CI, 8.39%-19.42%), and the incidence in patients who received IOL implantation was 5.56% (5 of 90 eyes; 95% CI, 8.23%-10.28%). The preoperative central corneal thickness (hazard ratio, 1.003; 95% CI, 1.001 to 1.004; P=0.004) and a family history of congenital cataracts (hazard ratio, 2.314; 95% CI, 1.004-5.331; P=0.049) were significant risk factors in patients without IOL implantation. Patient age at the time of cataract surgery was not a statistically significant risk factor for the development of suspected glaucoma/glaucoma in patients without IOL implantation.
Identification of the incidence of and risk factors for suspected glaucoma/glaucoma may help clinicians monitor susceptible individuals and provide timely surveillance and interventions in a clinical setting. Age at the time of cataract surgery was not a risk factor for suspected glaucoma/glaucoma in patients without IOL implantation, and this may allow the timing window for pediatric cataract surgery to be expanded and support new insights into the optimal timing of surgery for standard care.";;;"The incidence of suspected glaucoma after cataract surgery was 10.70% [26 of 241 eyes; 95% confidence interval (CI), 6.88%-14.70%].

592;31616057;5 year incidence of YAG capsulotomy and PCO after cataract surgery with single-piece monofocal intraocular lenses: a real-world evidence study of 20,763 eyes.;[];Eye (London, England);"To evaluate the 3- and 5-year incidence of posterior capsule opacification (PCO) and neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) capsulotomy in patients following cataract surgery, comparing results for different single-piece acrylic hydrophilic and hydrophobic monofocal intraocular lens (IOL) models and other patient factors.
Electronic medical record data collected from seven United Kingdom (UK) National Health Service (NHS) ophthalmology clinics for routine, age-related (≥65 years) cataract surgeries that implanted single-piece acrylic monofocal IOLs during 2010-2013 were used to calculate 3- and 5-year incidence of Nd:YAG and PCO. IOL models of Alcon Acrysof, AMO Tecnis, Bausch & Lomb (B & L) Akreos, LenStec Softec, and Rayner Flex were analyzed. Pairwise comparisons were conducted between AcrySof IOLs and other IOLs using Bonferroni adjustment for multiplicity. Multivariate analyses were conducted adjusting for known confounders.
The incidence of Nd:YAG capsulotomy ranged between 2.4-12.6% at 3 years and 5.8-19.3% at 5 years post-cataract surgery. Similarly, the incidence of PCO ranged between 4.7-18.6% at 3 years and 7.1-22.6% at 5 years. When comparing all of the single-piece IOLs, AcrySof demonstrated the lowest incidence rates for both PCO and Nd:YAG (P < 0.001 for each comparison). From adjusted logistic regression analysis, AcrySof were associated with lower 3- and 5-year odds of Nd:YAG and PCO incidence.

593;31600819;[Calculating the Human Eye - The Evolution of Biometry for Cataract Surgery].;[];Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde;"Optical biometry is the standard diagnostic tool and essential basis for IOL calculation prior to cataract surgery today. Our article will provide a short overview of the historical development of biometry of the human eye and the formulas used for IOL calculation.
Selective literature search in books and journal articles via PubMed, Google Scholar and Google as well as close cooperation with IOLCon at Saarland University, Homburg/Saar (Germany).
For first measurements of the eye, ultrasound was applied invasively. Today, ultrasound is mostly restricted to cases where optical biometry cannot be performed due to opaque optical media. However, today, most of the modern biometers are working with OCT non-invasively. Along with this technical evolution, numerous formulas have been developed for calculating the optical power of each respective IOL. Intraocular lenses can be calculated with different strategies: with empirical formulas, the IOL power is derived from a series of biometric data without any anatomical or physical background. With the theoretical-optical formulas, which are most commonly used today, the IOL power is extracted from a paraxial optical model which simplifies the eye to linear Gaussian optics. With modern raytracing settings, the Snell's law is applied at each refracting surface within the eye and the best focus position is compared with the position of the fovea.
Today, an increasing number of eyes that underwent refractive surgery previously are facing cataract surgery. Maybe even more important than adequate biometry of the human eye will be using appropriate calculation schemes in order to enhance post-cataract refractive outcomes or predictability.
Die optische Biometrie gilt heute als Standarddiagnostik und stellt die wesentliche Grundlage für die IOL-Berechnung vor der Kataraktoperation dar.

Für erste Messungen des Auges wurde Ultraschall invasiv angewendet. Ultraschall ist heutzutage meist auf Fälle beschränkt, in denen die optische Biometrie aufgrund trüber optischer Medien nicht durchgeführt werden kann. Heute arbeiten die meisten modernen Biometer nicht invasiv mithilfe der OCT, und durch intelligente Scanstrategien sind nahezu alle Augen messbar. Neben dieser technischen Entwicklung wurden zahlreiche Formeln entwickelt, um die optische Leistung der jeweiligen IOL zu berechnen. Intraokularlinsen können mit unterschiedlichen Strategien berechnet werden: Mit empirischen Formeln wird die IOL-Leistung aus einer Reihe biometrischer Daten ohne anatomischen oder physikalischen Hintergrund abgeleitet. Bei den heute am häufigsten verwendeten theoretisch-optischen Formeln wird die IOL-Leistung einem paraxialen optischen Modell entnommen, das das Auge im Sinne der linearen Gaußʼschen Optik vereinfacht. Beim modernen Raytracing wird das Snellʼsche Gesetz auf jede Refraktionsfläche im Auge angewendet und die beste Fokusposition mit der Position der Fovea verglichen.
Heutzutage muss sich eine wachsende Anzahl von Augen, die sich zuvor einer refraktiven Operation unterzogen hatte, einer Katarakt-OP unterziehen. Noch wichtiger als eine angemessene Biometrie des menschlichen Auges ist die Verwendung geeigneter Berechnungsschemata, die dazu beitragen, die Vorhersagbarkeit des refraktiven Ergebnisses nach der Katarakt-OP zu verbessern.";;;For first measurements of the eye, ultrasound was applied invasively.

Glaucoma was defined using internationally accepted taxonomies based on the consequences of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Glaucoma related adverse events were any involving elevated IOP. Multivariable analysis was undertaken to investigate potential predictors of secondary glaucoma with adjustment for within-child correlation in bilateral cataract. Unilateral and bilateral cataract were analysed separately.
Complete follow-up data were available for 235 of 254, 93% of the inception cohort. By 5 years after primary cataract surgery, 20% of children with bilateral cataract and 12% with unilateral had developed secondary glaucoma. Glaucoma related complications had been diagnosed in 24% and 36% of children, respectively. Independent predictors of glaucoma were younger age at surgery (adjusted OR for reduction of week in age: 1.1, 95%C I 1.1 to 1.2, p<0.001); the presence of significant ocular comorbidity (adj OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 9.6, p=0.01); and shorter axial length (adj OR for each mm 1.7, 95% CI 10.0 to 1, p=0.05) for bilateral cataract. Shorter axial length was the single independent factor in unilateral disease (adj OR 9.6, 95% CI 1.7 to 52, p=0.009) CONCLUSIONS: Both younger age at surgery (the strongest marker of ocular 'immaturity') and smaller ocular size (a marker of both immaturity and developmental vulnerability) can be used to identify those at greatest risk of glaucoma due to early life cataract surgery.";;;"Complete follow-up data were available for 235 of 254, 93% of the inception cohort.

After a mean follow-up of 38 ± 1.95 months, Nd:YAG capsulotomy occurred at a rate of 15.4% and 46.2% in the EyeCee One and iMics1 groups, respectively (p < 0.01). Respective mean PCO scores measured by AQUA were 1.57 ± 1.63 and 2.45 ± 1.44 (p = 0.019). A distinct gap between the anterior capsule and the IOL optic was present in 89% of eyes implanted with EyeCee One and 13% of iMics1 eyes. A gap between the posterior capsule and the posterior surface of the lens was observed in 76% of EyeCee One eyes and 35% of iMics1 eyes.
Study findings suggest that PCO and Nd:YAG capsulotomy rates are significantly lower in eyes implanted with the EyeCee One IOL compared to the iMics1 IOL. Optic sharpness and lens material seem to be the decisive factors, while the stepped edge beneath the haptic junction appeared to be ineffective.";;;After a mean follow-up of 38 ± 1.95 months, Nd:YAG capsulotomy occurred at a rate of 15.4% and 46.2% in the EyeCee One and iMics1 groups, respectively (p < 0.01).

Retrospective study of consecutive cases.
Study of patients with scleral-sutured IOL with aphakia, subluxated or luxated IOL were included. Follow-up was longer than 6 months and patients over 18 years of age. Preoperative data (best-corrected visual acuity testing (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), axial length and slit-lamp examination), intraoperative data (characteristics of the scleral flaps, suture material (Prolene or Mersilene) and scleral-sutured IOL) and postoperative data (BCVA, IOP, slit-lamp examination and complications) through 10 years were collected for analysis.
345 consecutive cases of scleral-sutured IOL were included. 25 eyes underwent a second operation after a prior sutured IOL due to suture breakage (mean 40.2±39.6 months after the first surgery) and three of them needed a third surgery. Younger adults (less than 40-year old), the use of a combination of Prolene and Mersilene sutures to perform the surgery and suturing only one flap were found to have higher risk of suture breakage after a follow-up of 10 years. The probability of surviving of the scleral-sutured IOL at 10 years after surgery was 0.79.

In this prospective study, the outcomes of DMEK with or without mydriasis (0.5% tropicamide and 0.5% phenylephrine hydrochloride [Mydrin-P; Santen, Osaka, Japan]) after the DMEK procedure were analyzed. Patients underwent IOL implantation approximately 4 weeks before DMEK. Six months after DMEK, the iris posterior synechiae severity score was evaluated based on the extent of posterior synechiae affecting the eight areas (45° each) of the pupillary rim (posterior synechiae score; grades 0-8). Best spectacle-corrected visual acuity, central corneal thickness, endothelial cell density, axial length, and the amount of air at the end of the surgery were also evaluated.
Fifteen eyes of 15 patients (mydriatic: n=8, control: n=7) were eligible for inclusion. Iris posterior synechiae were detected in all seven eyes (100.0%) in the control group, whereas they were noted in two eyes in the mydriatic group (25%).

Retrospective non-randomized consecutive case series.
Ninety eyes of 60 paediatric cataract patients were enrolled to this retrospective non-randomized observational consecutive case series single-centre study. All patients underwent cataract surgery with bag-in-the-lens IOL implantation between January 2008 and December 2018, performed by two experienced surgeons. The entire cohort was divided into four age groups: first - 0-<3 months, second - 3-<12 months, third - 12-<36 and fourth - >36 months-17 years of age. The intra- and postoperative complications were based on the clinical records. The description of management of complications related specifically to bag-in-the-lens IOL technique was based on the 39 consecutive cases operated since 1 Jan 2016 by one single surgeon that were all video documented. The early postoperative period was defined as 12 months after surgery.
Overall, there were 27 unilateral and 33 bilateral surgical cases of 24 female and 36 male children. The mean age at surgery was 45.25 months (range 1-200 months). The most common intraoperative events were vitreous prolapse and anterior capsule rupture with 28.9% and 13.3%, respectively. Within 12 months of follow-up, five eyes (5.6%) were re-operated because of visual axis reo-pacification (VAR). Intraocular hypertension was diagnosed in seven eyes (7.8%), including two cases that required surgical treatment. In all cases with intra- and early postoperative complications related specifically to bag-in-the-lens technique, it was possible to manage them and successfully implant bag-in-the-lens IOL.
Implementation of bag-in-the-lens technique in the treatment of paediatric cataract was associated with a relatively low rate of intra- and postoperative complications, including rare cases of VAR.

When combined phacovitrectomy is performed, the biometry decisions can be challenging both in the face of macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachments and previous refractive surgery. This study analyses current trends in practise.
A scenario-related survey was sent to all members of the British and Eire Association of Vitreoretinal Surgeons and to vitreoretinal surgeons in the northern Indian state of Punjab.
In post-laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis patients with a visually significant cataract and a macula-on rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, the majority of British and Eire Association of Vitreoretinal Surgeons members (67.3%) and surgeons in Punjab (91.4%) would perform a stand-alone para plana vitrectomy and defer cataract surgery. When a combined phacovitrectomy is performed in this scenario, the majority of British and Eire Association of Vitreoretinal Surgeons (68%) would implant an intraocular lens (using either Haigis-L or European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons/American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons calculators), whereas the majority of Punjab surgeons (79.3%) would leave the patient aphakic. In a patient with a cataract and macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment undergoing combined phacovitrectomy surgery, without any previous refractive surgery, the majority of British and Eire Association of Vitreoretinal Surgeons members (47.3%) would use the opposite eye biometry, whereas most Punjab surgeons (62.7%) would leave the patient aphakic.

Eleven eyes of 11 patients with late in-the-capsular-bag intraocular lens dislocation following uneventful phacoemulsification cataract surgery were recruited in the study. The dislocated intraocular lens-capsular bag complex was sutured to the iris at two points 180° apart using 9-0 polypropylene sutures on long needles.
Mean patient age was 67 ± 6 years. Seven eyes had pseudoexfoliation syndrome, one eye had Marfan syndrome, and another eye had a traumatic cataract; no risk factor was identified for intraocular lens dislocation in two eyes. A capsular tension ring had been implanted during cataract surgery in four eyes. In six eyes, the posterior chamber intraocular lenses were one-piece foldable while the remaining were three-piece intraocular lenses. Compared to the preoperative value, corrected distance visual acuity was significantly improved postoperatively (

Cross-sectional study including patients submitted to cataract surgery between January 2010 and March 2012, with implantation of the LS-502-1 intraocular lens. Past medical history was registered and a complete ophthalmologic evaluation, that included best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp examination and fundoscopy, was performed. Anterior segment photographs were taken whenever intraocular lens opacification was present.
One hundred and sixty-nine eyes of 154 patients were included, mean age 78.5 ± 7.9 years. The average follow-up after intraocular lens implantation was 65.6 ± 10.0 months. Intraocular lens opacification was seen in 53.3% (n = 90) and presented as one of four different patterns: peripheral (15.6%, n = 14), central (4.4%, n = 4), diffuse (71.1%, n = 64) and superficial white deposits (8.9%, n = 8). There was no statistically significant association with systemic or ophthalmic conditions. In patients with bilateral implantation, intraocular lens opacification in one eye was significantly related to intraocular lens opacification in the fellow eye. A significant variability in opacification was found across intraocular lens serial numbers: the odds ratio for opacification in intraocular lens with serial number beginning with 200003 was 6.0 when comparing with the remaining lenses.
The opacification prevalence of the LS-502-1 intraocular lens was 53.3%, which is the highest ever described for any intraocular lens model. Our results suggest that this occurrence is secondary to an interaction between unknown patient variables and problems related to intraocular lens manufacturing and storage procedures.";The opacification prevalence of the LS-502-1 intraocular lens was 53.3%, which is the highest ever described for any intraocular lens model.

A 27-gauge nitinol flex loop was used to lasso each haptic of a dislocated 3-piece IOL. By retracting the loop, the haptic could be effectively locked to the instrument and externalized through a scleral tunnel, thereby fixating it to the sclera in a sutureless fashion.
A 50-year-old man presented with a posteriorly dislocated Sensar AR40e IOL (Abbott Medical Optics, Inc; Santa Barbara, CA) and retained lens material after a complicated cataract surgery in the left eye. His visual acuity was counting fingers at face. The patient underwent 27-gauge pars plana vitrectomy with successful rescue and refixation of the IOL using the nitinol flex loop. One week postoperatively, his visual acuity had improved to 20/40.
