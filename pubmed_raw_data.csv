0;32792694;Surgical and visual outcomes of posterior dislocated lens fragments after cataract surgery during 5-years at a tertiary eye hospital of North India.;[];Nepalese journal of ophthalmology : a biannual peer-reviewed academic journal of the Nepal Ophthalmic Society : NEPJOPH;"To determine the surgical and visual outcomes of posteriorly dislocated lens fragments in the vitreous cavity in patients undergoing cataract surgery.
A total of 149 eyes of 149 patients from 2013 to 2018 were included in the study. The primary cataract surgery was performed either at the base hospital and its peripheral centres or referred from elsewhere. Pars plana vasectomy and nucleus removal was performed along with implantation of intraocular lens, wherever possible. Success was defined as best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) ≥ 6/12 at 3 months follow up. Poor visual outcome was defined as per WHO guidelines as BCVA ≤ 3/60.
Posterior capsular rupture and dislocation into vitreous cavity most frequently occurred during phaco-fragmentation in cases of phacoemulsification and during nucleus delivery in cases of small incision cataract surgery. Early vitrectomy was performed within 3 days in 36.2% of cases and within 14 days in 63.8% of cases. Successful visual outcome was achieved in 85.2% of patients at 3 months follow up after vitrectomy. Iatrogenic retinal break occurred in five patients during vitrectomyand five patients had retinal detachment. Poor visual outcome was observed in 12eyes, out of which glaucomatous optic neuropathy seen in 5 cases, cystoid or diabeticmacular edema in 4 cases and age related macular degeneration in 3 cases.
Posterior dislocation of lens can be successfully managed in majority of cases with vitreoretinal surgical intervention. The timing of vitrectomy whether performed early or late did not affect the visual outcome. The most important predictorof final visual acuity after PPV for retained lens fragments is a less complicated clinical course without any associated complications such as retinal detachment, cystoidmacula edema and glaucoma. Expertise of the primary cataract surgeon could not be assessed in this study, though surgeon grade with more experience is an important factor in the assessment of complications during the cataract surgery.";Posterior dislocation of lens can be successfully managed in majority of cases with vitreoretinal surgical intervention.

3;31987642;Outcomes of Bilateral Cataracts Removed in Infants 1 to 7 Months of Age Using the Toddler Aphakia and Pseudophakia Treatment Study Registry.;[];Ophthalmology;"To evaluate outcomes of bilateral cataract surgery in infants 1 to 7 months of age performed by Infant Aphakia Treatment Study (IATS) investigators during IATS recruitment and to compare them with IATS unilateral outcomes.
Retrospective case series review at 10 IATS sites.
The Toddler Aphakia and Pseudophakia Study (TAPS) is a registry of children treated by surgeons who participated in the IATS.
Children underwent bilateral cataract surgery with or without intraocular lens (IOL) placement during IATS enrollment years 2004 through 2010.
Visual acuity (VA), strabismus, adverse events (AEs), and reoperations.
One hundred seventy-eight eyes (96 children) were identified with a median age of 2.5 months (range, 1-7 months) at the time of cataract surgery. Forty-two eyes (24%) received primary IOL implantation. Median VA of the better-seeing eye at final study visit closest to 5 years of age with optotype VA testing was 0.35 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR; optotype equivalent, 20/45; range, 0.00-1.18 logMAR) in both aphakic and pseudophakic children. Corrected VA was excellent (<20/40) in 29% of better-seeing eyes, 15% of worse-seeing eyes. One percent showed poor acuity (≥20/200) in the better-seeing eye, 12% in the worse-seeing eye. Younger age at surgery and smaller (<9.5 mm) corneal diameter at surgery conferred an increased risk for glaucoma or glaucoma suspect designation (younger age: odds ratio [OR], 1.44; P = 0.037; and smaller cornea: OR, 3.95; P = 0.045). Adverse events also were associated with these 2 variables on multivariate analysis (younger age: OR, 1.36; P = 0.023; and smaller cornea: OR, 4.78; P = 0.057). Visual axis opacification was more common in pseudophakic (32%) than aphakic (8%) eyes (P = 0.009).

Visual acuity after bilateral cataract surgery in infants younger than 7 months is good, despite frequent systemic and ocular comorbidities.

This prospective interventional case series study was conducted at Ophthalmology Department, Kragujevac Clinical Centre, Kragujevac, Serbia. The study included 123 eyes of 123 cataract patients, 66 women and 57 men, age range 50-88 (mean 70.73±7.94) years having undergone phacoemulsification and in-the-bag implantation of a foldable IOL. The patients were treated at Kragujevac Clinical Centre between June 2015 and May 2016. IOP was measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry preoperatively, then 4-6 hours, 18-24 hours and 7 days postoperatively by the same examiner. The mean IOP preoperatively was 15.10±2.68 mm Hg. In three patients, maximum measured IOP was 22 mm Hg. At 4-6 hours postoperatively, the mean IOP was 24.29±7.56 mm Hg (p<0.001), at 18-24 hours it was 18.37±4.80 mm Hg (p<0.001), and 7 days after the surgery the mean IOP was 16.24±2.90 mm Hg (p<0.05). The measured IOP values were statistically significant in all measured times. However, at 4-6 hours and 18-24 hours, the mean IOP value was highly statistically significant (p<0.001). Although 7 days after the surgery IOP normalized, the mean IOP value was statistically significant (p<0.05). In conclusion, our research showed that even eyes with normal preoperative values and uncomplicated phacoemulsification course can show very high IOP values postoperatively, which can cause pain, blurred vision and, rarely, compromise visual function.;;;;;10.20471/acc.2019.58.03.10;2020-01-24;"[{'lastname': 'Todorović', 'firstname': 'Miloš', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': '1Oftalmos, Paraćin, Serbia; 2Ophthalmology Department, Kragujevac Clinical Centre, Kragujevac, Serbia; 3Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Kragujevac, Kragujevac, Serbia.'}, {'lastname': 'Šarenac Vulović', 'firstname': 'Tatjana', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': '1Oftalmos, Paraćin, Serbia; 2Ophthalmology Department, Kragujevac Clinical Centre, Kragujevac, Serbia; 3Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Kragujevac, Kragujevac, Serbia.'}, {'lastname': 'Petrović', 'firstname': 'Nenad', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': '1Oftalmos, Paraćin, Serbia; 2Ophthalmology Department, Kragujevac Clinical Centre, Kragujevac, Serbia; 3Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Kragujevac, Kragujevac, Serbia.'}, {'lastname': 'Todorović', 'firstname': 'Dušan', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': '1Oftalmos, Paraćin, Serbia; 2Ophthalmology Department, Kragujevac Clinical Centre, Kragujevac, Serbia; 3Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Kragujevac, Kragujevac, Serbia.'}, {'lastname': 'Srećković', 'firstname': 'Sunčica', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': '1Oftalmos, Paraćin, Serbia; 2Ophthalmology Department, Kragujevac Clinical Centre, Kragujevac, Serbia; 3Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Kragujevac, Kragujevac, Serbia.'}]"

A Scheimpflug device (Pentacam HR) was prospectively used to determine the tilt and decentration of IOLs in vivo 3 months after cataract surgery. A new method was developed to reliably measure PA and LOS. We further evaluated CTA and then used Spearman correlation coefficient and linear regression to assess the correlation between CDVA and IOL displacement based on the data of three different ocular axes.
Forty-six eyes from 46 patients were evaluated. The majority of decentration and tilt of IOL with reference to CTA, PA and LOS were towards the subtemporal direction. We found that the horizontal meridian data measured using CTA and PA were statistically significantly different (p = 0.011 for tilt; p = 0.005 for decentration). The correlation between CDVA and the distance of decentration temporally (r = -0.344, p = 0.035) and inferiorly (r = -0.336, p = 0.042) of the IOL with regard to CTA was significant.

This led to the proposal of several drugs, yet drug delivery into the capsular bag remains challenging. The intraocular lens as a drug delivery device would provide a convenient method to allow drug release in the location needed. This is to evaluate the effect of a drug-eluting intraocular lens using an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor.

The cellular response on the modified intraocular lenses was tested in a human lens epithelial cell line (FHL-124) in an anterior segment model. Furthermore, modified intraocular lenses were implanted into human capsular bags 
Both coated hydrophilic and hydrophobic intraocular lenses could attenuate the cell growth of FHL-124 cells in the human capsular bag in comparison to the unmodified controls. Furthermore, gefitinib-soaked intraocular lenses showed a constant drug release over the first 10 days. No reduction in cell viability of corneal endothelial cells occurred.

Many different approaches appear in the literature without any specific procedure achieving superior outcomes. Advantages and disadvantages vary between techniques. Common complications related to IOL fixation techniques were as follow: anterior chamber IOL: transient/permanent corneal oedema (9-66.6%), uveitis (1.1-39.3%); iris-fixated IOL: pupil ovalization (16-47.7%); and sutured scleral-fixated IOL: suture breakage/exposure (6.1-11%), vitreous haemorrhage: (5.5-16.6%). In our retrospective case series, indications for surgery were postoperative aphakia in 50 eyes (49%), IOL dislocation in 38 eyes (37%) and natural lens dislocation in 15 eyes (14%). Scleral tunnels for haptic fixation were created with (28 eyes, 27.2%) or without (75 eyes, 72.8%) 25 gauge trocar cannulas. Complications included transient hypotony (n = 20; 19.4%), corneal decompensation (n = 7; 6.7%), IOL dislocation (n = 6; 5.8%), cystoid macular oedema (n = 5; 4.8%), vitreous haemorrhage (n = 4; 3.8%) and retinal detachment (n = 4; 3.8%). Mean best corrected visual acuity improved from logMAR 0.65 to 0.36 at the final visit (p = 0.001). In conclusion, SIS fixation provides good anatomical and functional outcomes; however, complications can occur. The number of surgical approaches for IOL dislocation described in the literature indicates that optimal treatment remains to be found.";;;;© 2019 Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica Foundation.

Ninety-four eyes of consecutive 94 patients who underwent scleral-fixated IOL implantation with Z-suture technique were included in this prospective study. The values of pre- and postoperative 12th month uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), cylindrical refractive error, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and corneal and lenticular astigmatism were recorded. The position of the implanted IOL was evaluated with anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT). The relationships between the AS-OCT measurements and the visual acuity or refractive errors were investigated.
The IOL position was evaluated as tilted in 68 (72.3%) patients: 29 (30.8%) in both vertical + horizontal axes, 30 (31.9%) in the horizontal axis and 9 (9.6%) in the vertical axis. There were no significant differences between patients with and without tilt IOL position in terms of the UCVA, BCVA, cylindrical refractive error and lenticular astigmatism (p > 0.05, for each).

Eyes from 14 patients who underwent 27-gauge needle-guided intrascleral IOL fixation with built-in 8-0 absorbable sutures were studied. The 8-0 absorbable sutures were inserted into 27-gauge round needles and used to create sclerotomies at the 4 o'clock and 10 o'clock positions under the scleral flap. The sutures were used to tie knots at the end of each haptic and guide haptic externalization through the sclerotomy. After externalization, a sufficient flange was created at the end of each haptic and fixed under the scleral flaps. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), corneal endothelial cell density (ECD), IOL tilt and decentration, previous surgery history, and complications were determined.

Records of patients examined for cataracts from January 2007 to February 2018 were divided into two groups: nonsurgical and surgical. The nonsurgical group was further subdivided based on whether the decision not to pursue surgery was elected by owners, or based on ophthalmologist's advice. Inclusion criteria included 6 months of follow-up. Success in the nonsurgical group was defined as a comfortable eye with no potentially painful complications, and success in the surgical group additionally required vision. Time-to-failure (complications) was assessed with Cox proportional hazards models.
A total of 72 eyes (41 dogs) were included in the nonsurgical group, and 126 eyes (67 dogs) were surgically treated. There was no difference in gender or age; however, the surgical group had significantly more diabetic eyes (56.3% vs 15.3%; P < .001) and patient eyes with longer follow-up times (median 37.6 months vs 22.1 months; P < .001) than the nonsurgical group.

26;31745327;The human capsular bag model of posterior capsule opacification.;[];Eye (London, England);"Posterior capsule opacification (PCO) is the most common complication following cataract surgery and affects millions of patients. PCO is a consequence of surgical injury promoting a wound-healing response. Following surgery, residual lens epithelial cells grow on acellular regions of the lens capsule, including the central posterior capsule. These cells can undergo fibrotic changes, such that cell transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts, matrix deposition and matrix contraction can occur, which contribute to light scatter and the need for further corrective Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy in many patients. It is therefore of great importance to better understand how PCO develops and determine better approaches to manage the condition. To achieve this, experimental systems are required, and many are available to study PCO. While there may be a number of common features associated with PCO in different species, the mechanisms governing the condition can differ. Consequently, where possible, human systems should be employed. The human capsular bag model was established in a laboratory setting on donor eyes. A capsulorhexis is performed to create an opening in the anterior capsule followed by removal of the lens fibre mass. Residual fibre cells can be removed by irrigation/aspiration and if required, an intraocular lens can be implanted. The capsular bag is isolated from the eye and transferred to a dish for culture. The human capsular bag model has played an important role in understanding the biological processes driving PCO and enables evaluation of surgical approaches, IOLs and putative therapeutic agents to better manage PCO.
摘要: 后囊浑浊 (PCO) 是白内障术后最常见的并发症, 且影响着数百万患者。PCO是手术损伤后促进伤口发生愈合反应的结果。术后残余的晶状体上皮细胞在晶状体囊无细胞区域生长, 包括后囊中央区。这些细胞可发生纤维化改变, 从而使上皮细胞转分化为肌成纤维细胞, 并可能发生基质沉积和基质收缩, 这将会导致晶状体的光散射, 使许多病人需要更进一步的矫正措施—Nd: YAG激光后囊切开术。因此, 更全面地了解PCO是如何发生发展的和采取更好的措施来处理这些情况是极其重要的。为了实现这个实验, 系统是必须的, 且许多都可用于PCO的研究。虽然在不同物种中可能有许多与PCO相关的共同特点, 但控制情况的机制可以不同。因此在可能的情况下, 应采用人类 (真人的) 系统。在实验室条件下建立了供眼人类囊袋模型。实施撕囊术在前囊形成一个开口, 然后去除晶状体纤维团块。残余的纤维细胞可以通过冲洗或抽吸去除, 如果需要的话, 可植入眼内人工晶状体。将囊袋从眼中分离出来, 转移至培养皿内培养。人类囊袋模型在理解PCO生物学过程中起重要作用, 并使手术方法, 人工晶状体和假定的治疗药物的评估能更好地管理PCO。.";;;;;10.1038/s41433-019-0680-z;2019-11-21;[{'lastname': 'Wormstone', 'firstname': 'I Michael', 'initials': 'IM', 'affiliation': 'School of Biological Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK. i.m.wormstone@uea.ac.uk.'}]

Ekol Eye Hospital, Izmir, Turkey.
Retrospective case series.
Intraocular lens decentration and angle of tilt were measured using a Scheimpflug camera before and 1 month after Nd:YAG capsulotomy.
Eighteen eyes had a femtosecond laser-assisted capsulotomy and 25 eyes a manual capsulorhexis. The mean age was 58.2 years ± 10.2 (SD) (range 44 to 69 years) and 60.6 ± 8.3 years (range 45 to 70 years), respectively. Before capsulotomy, the angle of tilt and decentration at both meridians did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (P > .05). After capsulotomy, the angle of tilt was significantly decreased in both groups (femtosecond: vertical 1.5 degrees and horizontal 1.2 degrees; manual: vertical 1.1 degrees and horizontal) and decentration was significantly increased (femtosecond: vertical 0.085 mm and horizontal 0.096 mm; manual: vertical 0.2 mm and horizontal 0.2 mm) at both meridians (P < .05). After capsulotomy, all tilt and decentration parameters were significantly different between the 2 groups (P < .05) except decentration on the horizontal meridian (P = .669).
Nd:YAG posterior capsulotomy performed after femtosecond laser-assisted capsulotomy resulted in better mechanical stability of the IOL. This suggests that a femtosecond laser-created capsulotomy better maintains a proper IOL position. Although the differences were statistically significant, the tilt and decentration values were small and might not be clinically significant.";;;"Eighteen eyes had a femtosecond laser-assisted capsulotomy and 25 eyes a manual capsulorhexis.

Consecutive patients treated with phacoemulsification were recruited. IOP was measured before and 1 day, 3 days, 1 week and 3 months after surgery. Axial length (AL) and anterior chamber depth (ACD) were recorded, and optic disc tilt, rotation and beta-zone peripapillary atrophy (β-PPA) were measured from fundus photographs taken 1 week after surgery. Backward stepwise multiple linear regression was used to investigate the risk factors for early transient IOP spike in the HMC group.
Finally, 94 eyes of 94 HMC patients and 67 eyes of 67 age-related cataract (ARC) controls were included in analysis. The incidence of early IOP spike was 10% in the ARC group and 28% in the HMC group (OR=3.277, p<0.05) at 1 day after surgery. In the HMC group with IOP spikes, more males were seen and affected eyes showed longer AL, shallower ACD, greater optic disc tilt, and larger β-PPA than those without (all p<0.05).

Currently, the only way to treat it effectively is phacoemulsification with simultaneous implantation of an intraocular lens - a method that minimizes the amount of surgical trauma and the number of intra- and postoperative complications. Nevertheless, the problem of prevention and timely diagnosis of pathological changes in the retina, which may develop after extraction of cataracts, and in particular - macular edema, remains relevant. This problem becomes especially important when it comes to patients with concomitant cataract and glaucoma who use local antihypertensive drugs - in particular, prostaglandin analogues - for a long time. Having common properties with inflammatory mediators, in some cases they can cause vasodilation, increase vascular permeability and contribute to the development of exudative processes. Drugs of this group can cause impairment of the hematophthalmic and hematoretinal barriers provoking the development of cystoid macular edema, including in the early postoperative period after cataract extraction. As described by S. Irvine in 1953, macular edema is related to late postoperative complications and remains one of the main causes of visual impairment after lens removal. The review provides information about some studies concerning the effect of prostaglandin derivatives on the postoperative period after phacoemulsification. At this time, there is no consensus on this matter.
Возрастная катаракта является одной из наиболее частых причин обратимого снижения зрения у людей старше 50 лет. В настоящее время единственным эффективным способом ее лечения считается факоэмульсификация (ФЭ) с одномоментной имплантацией интраокулярной линзы - метод, позволяющий свести к минимуму объем хирургической травмы и число интра- и послеоперационных осложнений. Тем не менее остается актуальной проблема профилактики и своевременной диагностики патологических изменений сетчатки, которые могут развиваться после экстракции катаракты, в частности макулярного отека. Эта проблема становится особенно важной, когда речь идет о сочетании катаракты и глаукомы, при которой пациенты длительно используют местные гипотензивные средства, в частности аналоги простагландинов. Имея общие свойства с медиаторами воспаления, они могут в некоторых случаях вызывать вазодилатацию, усиливать проницаемость сосудов и способствовать развитию экссудативных процессов. Под действием препаратов этой группы возможно нарушение гематоофтальмического и гематоретинального барьеров, что может провоцировать развитие кистозного макулярного отека, в том числе и в раннем послеоперационном периоде после экстракции катаракты. Макулярный отек, описанный S. Irvine в 1953 г., относится к поздним послеоперационным осложнениям и остается одной из главных причин снижения зрения после удаления хрусталика. В работе приведены сведения о некоторых исследованиях, посвященных влиянию производных простагландинов на течение послеоперационного периода после ФЭ. В настоящее время однозначного мнения по этому вопросу не существует.";;;;;10.17116/oftalma2019135052241;2019-11-07;[{'lastname': 'Erichev', 'firstname': 'V P', 'initials': 'VP', 'affiliation': 'Research Institute of Eye Diseases, 11A Rossolimo St., Moscow, Russian Federation, 119021.'}, {'lastname': 'Kozlova', 'firstname': 'I V', 'initials': 'IV', 'affiliation': 'Research Institute of Eye Diseases, 11A Rossolimo St., Moscow, Russian Federation, 119021.'}, {'lastname': 'Kosova', 'firstname': 'J V', 'initials': 'JV', 'affiliation': 'Research Institute of Eye Diseases, 11A Rossolimo St., Moscow, Russian Federation, 119021.'}]

49;31600819;[Calculating the Human Eye - The Evolution of Biometry for Cataract Surgery].;[];Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde;"Optical biometry is the standard diagnostic tool and essential basis for IOL calculation prior to cataract surgery today. Our article will provide a short overview of the historical development of biometry of the human eye and the formulas used for IOL calculation.
Selective literature search in books and journal articles via PubMed, Google Scholar and Google as well as close cooperation with IOLCon at Saarland University, Homburg/Saar (Germany).
For first measurements of the eye, ultrasound was applied invasively. Today, ultrasound is mostly restricted to cases where optical biometry cannot be performed due to opaque optical media. However, today, most of the modern biometers are working with OCT non-invasively. Along with this technical evolution, numerous formulas have been developed for calculating the optical power of each respective IOL. Intraocular lenses can be calculated with different strategies: with empirical formulas, the IOL power is derived from a series of biometric data without any anatomical or physical background. With the theoretical-optical formulas, which are most commonly used today, the IOL power is extracted from a paraxial optical model which simplifies the eye to linear Gaussian optics. With modern raytracing settings, the Snell's law is applied at each refracting surface within the eye and the best focus position is compared with the position of the fovea.
Today, an increasing number of eyes that underwent refractive surgery previously are facing cataract surgery. Maybe even more important than adequate biometry of the human eye will be using appropriate calculation schemes in order to enhance post-cataract refractive outcomes or predictability.

Für erste Messungen des Auges wurde Ultraschall invasiv angewendet. Ultraschall ist heutzutage meist auf Fälle beschränkt, in denen die optische Biometrie aufgrund trüber optischer Medien nicht durchgeführt werden kann. Heute arbeiten die meisten modernen Biometer nicht invasiv mithilfe der OCT, und durch intelligente Scanstrategien sind nahezu alle Augen messbar. Neben dieser technischen Entwicklung wurden zahlreiche Formeln entwickelt, um die optische Leistung der jeweiligen IOL zu berechnen. Intraokularlinsen können mit unterschiedlichen Strategien berechnet werden: Mit empirischen Formeln wird die IOL-Leistung aus einer Reihe biometrischer Daten ohne anatomischen oder physikalischen Hintergrund abgeleitet. Bei den heute am häufigsten verwendeten theoretisch-optischen Formeln wird die IOL-Leistung einem paraxialen optischen Modell entnommen, das das Auge im Sinne der linearen Gaußʼschen Optik vereinfacht. Beim modernen Raytracing wird das Snellʼsche Gesetz auf jede Refraktionsfläche im Auge angewendet und die beste Fokusposition mit der Position der Fovea verglichen.
Heutzutage muss sich eine wachsende Anzahl von Augen, die sich zuvor einer refraktiven Operation unterzogen hatte, einer Katarakt-OP unterziehen. Noch wichtiger als eine angemessene Biometrie des menschlichen Auges ist die Verwendung geeigneter Berechnungsschemata, die dazu beitragen, die Vorhersagbarkeit des refraktiven Ergebnisses nach der Katarakt-OP zu verbessern.";;;For first measurements of the eye, ultrasound was applied invasively.

The purpose of this study was to identify cases of postoperative vision loss caused by slight intraocular lens (IOL) malpositioning after cataract surgery.
Three patients presented with visual acuity decreased after cataract surgery. Silt-lamp examination before mydriasis revealed no abnormalities in two of the patients; mild IOL inferonasal decentration was found by the trifocal IOL diffraction ring in the third patient. Manifest refraction of these patients showed remarkable astigmatism with low corneal astigmatism. After pupil dilation, slight IOL decentration and tilt were observed in all patients, which were further confirmed using the Scheimpflug imaging system. Wavefront aberrometry showed a high level of ocular higher-order aberrations, most of which were derived from intraocular aberrations.
Inconspicuous IOL malpositioning is one of the reasons responsible for decreased vision acuity after cataract surgery, which may not be easily identified by slit-lamp examination. High astigmatism and ocular higher-order aberrations derived from malpositioned IOL can be important clues.";;;;;10.1097/OPX.0000000000001430;2019-10-09;"[{'lastname': 'Rong', 'firstname': 'Xianfang', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': ""Department of Ophthalmology and the Eye Institute, Eye and Ear, Nose, and Throat Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.\nKey Laboratory of Myopia, Ministry of Health, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.\nShanghai Key Laboratory of Visual Impairment and Restoration, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.\nKey NHC Key Laboratory of Myopia, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.\nLaboratory of Myopia, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Miao', 'firstname': 'Ao', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Department of Ophthalmology and the Eye Institute, Eye and Ear, Nose, and Throat Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.\nKey Laboratory of Myopia, Ministry of Health, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.\nShanghai Key Laboratory of Visual Impairment and Restoration, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.\nKey NHC Key Laboratory of Myopia, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.\nLaboratory of Myopia, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Yu', 'firstname': 'Jifeng', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Department of Ophthalmology, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Children's Health, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Du', 'firstname': 'Yu', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Department of Ophthalmology and the Eye Institute, Eye and Ear, Nose, and Throat Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.\nKey Laboratory of Myopia, Ministry of Health, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.\nShanghai Key Laboratory of Visual Impairment and Restoration, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.\nKey NHC Key Laboratory of Myopia, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.\nLaboratory of Myopia, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'He', 'firstname': 'Wenwen', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': ""Department of Ophthalmology and the Eye Institute, Eye and Ear, Nose, and Throat Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.\nKey Laboratory of Myopia, Ministry of Health, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.\nShanghai Key Laboratory of Visual Impairment and Restoration, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.\nKey NHC Key Laboratory of Myopia, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.\nLaboratory of Myopia, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Lu', 'firstname': 'Yi', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Department of Ophthalmology and the Eye Institute, Eye and Ear, Nose, and Throat Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.\nKey Laboratory of Myopia, Ministry of Health, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.\nShanghai Key Laboratory of Visual Impairment and Restoration, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.\nKey NHC Key Laboratory of Myopia, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.\nLaboratory of Myopia, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Zhu', 'firstname': 'Xiangjia', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': ""Department of Ophthalmology and the Eye Institute, Eye and Ear, Nose, and Throat Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.\nKey Laboratory of Myopia, Ministry of Health, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.\nShanghai Key Laboratory of Visual Impairment and Restoration, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.\nKey NHC Key Laboratory of Myopia, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""}]"
51;31592957;Assessing the Validity of Measurements of Swept-source and Partial Coherence Interferometry Devices in Cataract Patients.;[];Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry;"The validity of measurements of OA-2000 (Tomey, Nagoya, Japan), a new swept-source optical coherence tomography-based biometer, was evaluated in comparison with IOLMaster 500 (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena, Germany) as a reference method for optical biometry in cataract patients.
This article compares the validity of measurements between OA-2000 and IOLMaster 500.
In this cross-sectional study, axial length, lens thickness, anterior chamber depth, and keratometry readings were obtained by the OA-2000 and IOLMaster 500. Two measurements were taken by each method. Patients in which any one of the biometry methods could not be performed owing to severity of the cataract were excluded from the study. Repeatability of measurements was presented by coefficient of variation, and Bland-Altman method was used for evaluating the agreement between the two biometers.
Fifty-eight eyes of 58 cataract patients with mean ± standard deviation age of 61.4 ± 8.3 years were included in this study. Intraclass correlation ranged from 0.898 to 0.901 and showed good to excellent reliability. It was good for keratometry 1 (0.898) and excellent for keratometry 2 (0.992), axial length (0.999), and anterior chamber depth (0.901). Bland-Altman analysis showed good agreement between the swept-source optical coherence tomography and partial coherence interferometry devices for axial length, anterior chamber depth, and mean keratometry, with narrow 95% limits of agreement (-0.09 to 0.1 mm, -0.33 to 0.54 mm, -0.97 to 1.03 D, respectively), and also indicated small mean difference (0.01 for axial length, 0.11 for anterior chamber depth, 0.03 for mean keratometry, respectively) for all comparisons.

Both were operated on while sitting in a strictly upright position, resting their chin in front of a mobile slitlamp in the same manner as during a standard ophthalmologic examination. The surgeon sits on the other side of the slitlamp, facing the patient, and operates via a temporal corneal incision. The described operating conditions were deemed perfectly adequate by the experienced surgeon. Both patients recovered a corrected distance visual acuity of 20/20 in both eyes and said they would recommend this surgery to anyone who cannot lie flat.

Retrospective nonrandomized consecutive case series.
Pediatric patients diagnosed with cataract and operated with BIL IOL implantation were divided into 4 age groups: Group 1 (0 to 3 months), Group 2 (>3 months, <12 months), Group 3 (12 to 36 months), and Group 4 (>36 months to 17 years). BIL IOL power was calculated with the SRK/T formula. The prediction error (PE) was defined as the absolute difference between the preoperative selected target and postoperative achieved refraction. The impact of age at the time of surgery, axial length (AL), keratometry, and corneal astigmatism on PE was analyzed.
The study comprised 87 eyes of 56 pediatric patients. The mean and median PEs for the entire group were 1.79 diopters (D) and 1.23 D, respectively. The mean PE in each age group was: 3.43 D in Group 1, 2.14 D in Group 2, 1.60 D in Group 3, and 1.33 D in Group 4.

Herein we describe a modified technique for the sutureless scleral fixation of a standard 3-piece PC IOL using self-sealing sclerotomies created with a crescent blade and a 20-gauge microvitreoretinal blade, and then reinserting the haptics to leave the tips inside the vitreous cavity.

To review our long-term surgical experience with childhood unilateral traumatic cataracts.
A retrospective observational study of children with unilateral traumatic cataracts with minimal follow-up of 5 years was conducted. Main outcomes included final visual acuity (VA) and occurrence of complications.
Of the 18 children included in the study, 83% were male. Mean follow-up time was 12.5 years. Median age at injury was 7.5 years. Eleven patients (61%) presented with penetrating trauma injuries and 7 (39%) with blunt trauma. Sixteen patients (89%) had cataracts at presentation, while in two the cataracts developed during follow-up. Of the 18 total, cataract removal surgery was conducted in 16 (89%) with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in 14 (87.5%), while 2 remained aphakic (12.5%). Two (11%) were treated conservatively. Long-term complications included IOL dislocation in 5 (36%), glaucoma in 8 (44%), and posterior capsular opacity in 10 (71%). No correlation was found between final visual acuity and the time interval between injury and IOL implantation nor between final VA and age at trauma. However, the final VA did correlate with time of follow-up.
Severe complications occurred in over 30% of the patients during a long follow-up (mean 12.5 years).

71;31539543;Histological comparison of in vitro and in vivo development of peripheral posterior capsule opacification in human donor tissue.;[];Experimental eye research;In order to study the mechanisms involved in the development of posterior capsule opacification (PCO) we compared in vivo developed PCO with PCO formed in tissue culture with focus on the periphery of the lens capsule to evaluate lens regeneration potential. We studied three human tissue groups: Cultured lens capsules after mock cataract surgery (n = 6, 30 days), lens capsules from donors that had previously undergone cataract surgery (IOL capsules) (n = 12) and intact lenses (n = 6). All samples were stained with Vimentin, alpha Smooth Muscle Actin, Picro Sirius Red (for collagen) and Paired box protein (Pax6). We found that cultured capsules and less developed IOL capsules consisted mainly of monolayers of mesenchymal cells, while more developed IOL capsules, contained lens epithelial cells (LECs), globular cells and lens fiber cells. Many IOL capsule samples expressed collagen I and III in areas where cells were in contact with the IOL. Pax6 had a similar dispersed distribution in less developed IOL capsules and cultured capsules, while more developed IOL capsules and intact lenses, concentrated Pax6 in LECs at the equatorial lens bow. The similarities between cultured capsules and less developed IOL capsules indicate that our in vitro developed PCO is comparable to early in vivo developed PCO. The similar morphology of more developed IOL capsules and intact lenses seems to indicate an attempt at lens regeneration.;;;;Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Patients may present to optometric practices because of symptom onset significantly after the immediate post-operative period.
The purpose of this study was to describe the defining clinical features, proposed pathophysiology, and treatment of late postoperative capsular block syndrome. Case 1 was a 68-year-old man who presented with a sudden onset of blurry vision in the right eye 2 years after uncomplicated cataract surgery. Clinical examination revealed turbid fluid distending the posterior lens capsule, a 2-D myopic shift, and an absence of intraocular inflammation. Laser posterior capsulotomy successfully released the trapped fluid and reversed the myopic shift without complication. Case 2 was a 67-year-old man who presented with a gradual onset of hazy vision in the right eye 7 years after uncomplicated cataract surgery. Cloudy fluid was observed to be filling the space between the intraocular lens and the posterior lens capsule, and the refractive error was stable. The fluid was liberated and visual function was restored with uncomplicated laser posterior capsulotomy.
Patients with late postoperative capsular block syndrome may present with blurry vision months to years after cataract surgery performed with continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis and posterior capsule intraocular lens implantation. The defining clinical sign is entrapment of turbid fluid between the intraocular lens and the posterior capsule that may result in reduced vision or refractive error shift. Late postoperative capsular block syndrome is distinguishable from other late complications of cataract surgery, including delayed endophthalmitis or phacoantigenic uveitis, by lack of concurrent robust ocular inflammation.";;;;;10.1097/OPX.0000000000001425;2019-09-04;[{'lastname': 'Sandhaus', 'firstname': 'Sarah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Flettner', 'firstname': 'Juliane Grace', 'initials': 'JG', 'affiliation': 'Santa Rosa Veterans Affairs Community Outreach Clinic, San Francisco Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, San Francisco, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Mick', 'firstname': 'Andrew B', 'initials': 'AB', 'affiliation': 'San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, California.\nSchool of Optometry, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California.\nUniversity of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California.'}]

Ophthalmology service, Consorcio Hospital General Universitario, Valencia, Spain.
Prospective triple-masked randomized single-center study.
Patients with cataractous eyes were recruited, and those with anterior segment disease, abnormal posterior pole, and/or previous ocular surgery were excluded. The principle of double-pass aberrometry was used by the main investigator to determine an OSI, after measuring subjective refraction and corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), and then slitlamp evaluation was carried out by an independent researcher. The surgical decision was based on the current protocol according to the European guidelines. Correlation between the surgical decision, CDVA, and OSI were analyzed and an OSI discriminative value was calculated, implementing a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
The study comprised 106 eyes (73 patients). The analysis established an inverse linear correlation between OSI and CDVA (r = -0.455, P < .0001). The comparison of the mean OSI between the surgical group (7.05 ± 4.65 [SD]) and the nonsurgical group (2.92 ± 1.88), revealed statistically significant differences (P = 5.04 × 10

Retrospective non-randomized consecutive case series.
Ninety eyes of 60 paediatric cataract patients were enrolled to this retrospective non-randomized observational consecutive case series single-centre study. All patients underwent cataract surgery with bag-in-the-lens IOL implantation between January 2008 and December 2018, performed by two experienced surgeons. The entire cohort was divided into four age groups: first - 0-<3 months, second - 3-<12 months, third - 12-<36 and fourth - >36 months-17 years of age. The intra- and postoperative complications were based on the clinical records. The description of management of complications related specifically to bag-in-the-lens IOL technique was based on the 39 consecutive cases operated since 1 Jan 2016 by one single surgeon that were all video documented. The early postoperative period was defined as 12 months after surgery.
Overall, there were 27 unilateral and 33 bilateral surgical cases of 24 female and 36 male children. The mean age at surgery was 45.25 months (range 1-200 months). The most common intraoperative events were vitreous prolapse and anterior capsule rupture with 28.9% and 13.3%, respectively. Within 12 months of follow-up, five eyes (5.6%) were re-operated because of visual axis reo-pacification (VAR). Intraocular hypertension was diagnosed in seven eyes (7.8%), including two cases that required surgical treatment.

This is a retrospective, noncomparative, consecutive, interventional case series of patients undergoing IOL removal at an academic referral center performed by a single surgeon between 2002 and 2013. Data collected included baseline patient characteristics, visual acuity (VA), type of IOL, reason for IOL removal, and postoperative complications.
The study cohort included 63 eyes with IOL removal. Of these, 51 (81%) were left aphakic. For cases of IOL opacification or dislocated IOL (56), the decision to remove was made for 35 (63%) during concurrent retinal surgery due to obstruction in visualization. Overall, the most common reason for removal of the IOL was IOL opacities in 42 eyes (67%), followed by nonspecific nature of opacities (n = 19; 45%), oil artifact (n = 17; 40%), opaque nonvascular membranes (n = 4; 10%), and fibrovascular proliferation (n = 2; 5%). Other causes for removal were IOL dislocation (n = 14; 22%), endophthalmitis (n = 7; 11%), and broken IOL haptic (n = 1; 2%). The composition of the 42 IOLs with opacification included 19 (45%) silicone, 14 (33%) unspecified, five (12%) polymethyl methacrylate, and four acrylic (10%).

Patients had cataract surgery with implantation of one of the three above-mentioned IOLs. Higher order aberrations (HOAs), modulation transfer function (MTF), point spread function (PSF), retinal straylight, and dysphotopsia phenomena were evaluated 3 months after surgery. IOL decentration was quantified as the distance between the visual axis center and the IOL center using the OPD-Scan III aberrometer (Nidek Co., Ltd., Gamagori, Japan). The patients who received each IOL type were then divided into two subgroups (decentration of ⩽ 0.25 or > 0.25 mm) to analyze the effect of IOL decentration on these optical qualities.
The study included 54 eyes (54 patients), with 18 eyes in each IOL group. The distance of IOL decentration did not differ significantly among the three groups.

In these cases there is always a higher rate of different kind of intraoperative complications. Phacoemulsification after penetrating keratoplasty especially in older people may cause significant endothelial injury and also could affect long term graft survival.
The aim of this report is to describe one of these challenging cases and the possible ways to manage them in developing countries.
In this paper we report a case of a 46 year-old female patient, with a cataract on her right eye with a central corneal leukoma. She reported that when she was 6 years old, she had an eye injury with corn leaf. At the age of 10 year she reported that she had another injury of the same eye with a glass. She reported that she wasn't seeing quite good after that. Three years ago she had a transplantation of amniotic membrane due ulcer on the same eye. She reported also that even after this procedure she wasn't seeing quite good. Now she was admitted to hospital for a triple surgical procedure. At that moment patient has been ophthalmological examined (visual acuity testing, biomicroscopy, tonometry, ultrasound of both eyes with biometry and ophthalmoscopy). At the day of admission to the hospital on slit lamp we found central corneal leukoma, occlusion of pupil and complicated cataract. Before surgery her Uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) on her left eye was light perception. A combined procedure of penetrating keratoplasty (PKP), open-sky cataract extraction, and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation was planned.

94;31389407;ROCK inhibitor modified intraocular lens as an approach for inhibiting the proliferation and migration of lens epithelial cells and posterior capsule opacification.;[];Biomaterials science;Lens epithelial cells (LECs) in the capsule play a critical role in posterior capsule opacification (PCO) formation following cataract surgery. Cytoskeleton remodeling and the related ROCK pathway are quite important during cell migration and proliferation, but their role in LECs is still unclear. This study aimed to explore the mechanism of the ROCK pathway in the behavior of LECs and established a drug modified IOL for PCO prevention. We observed that the ROCK pathway inhibitor (Y27632) or cofilin knockdown reduced HLEC-B3 migration and proliferation. Furthermore, we revealed that cofilin could regulate the migration and proliferation of LECs through its phosphorylation. Interestingly, the capping protein CAPZA1 and ERM family also had an effect on the behavior of LECs. In addition, we established Y27632-PLGA modified IOLs, implanted them into rabbit eyes and found them to exhibit good safety and biocompatibility in vivo. Moreover, satisfying PCO prevention results were observed at 28 days post-operation. In summary, the ROCK pathway and the cytoskeleton remodeling protein regulate cell migration and proliferation, and the Y27632-PLGA modified IOL can prevent PCO formation.;;;;;10.1039/c9bm00787c;2019-08-08;[{'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Lei', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'School of Ophthalmology and Optometry, Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China. zyehzeye@126.com zye@mail.eye.ac.cn lufan62@mail.eye.ac.cn 364669877@qq.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Quankui', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Jin', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Han', 'firstname': 'Yuemei', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Pingjun', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lu', 'firstname': 'Fan', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zhao', 'firstname': 'Yun-E', 'initials': 'YE', 'affiliation': None}]

Patients from the multicenter Study of an Implantable Device for Lowering Intraocular Pressure in Glaucoma Patients Undergoing Cataract Surgery (COMPASS) trial who underwent Micro-Stent implantation plus phacoemulsification (n = 215) or phacoemulsification alone (n = 67) were evaluated 36, 48, and 60 months postoperatively. The primary outcome measurement was the occurrence of sight-threatening ocular adverse events. Evaluations at each time point included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), anterior and posterior segment examinations, tonometry, gonioscopy, pachymetry, perimetry, specular microscopy, and assessment of adverse events.
Three sight-threatening ocular adverse events occurred, 2 in the Micro-Stent group and 1 in the control group, but none of these events was related to the Micro-Stent device. Ocular adverse events were of similar frequencies in both groups, the most common of which were BCVA loss of ≥2 lines compared with best BCVA in COMPASS and worsening of visual field mean defect (VFMD) ≥2.5 dB compared with month 24.

A prospective, nonrandomized study was implemented in adult cataract patients who underwent unilateral phacoemulsification with aspheric IOL implantation. Patients were allocated into two treatment groups: a customized group and a control group. In the customized group, the aspheric IOL selection was based on the corneal spherical aberration to enable the postoperative target ocular spherical aberration closest to zero; in the control group, the aspheric IOLs were chosen using a random strategy. Primary outcome measurements included the following objective optical quality assessments: higher-order aberrations obtained by a Hartmann-shack aberrometer at 4 mm and 6 mm pupil diameters; objective scatter index (OSI), modulation transfer function (MTF) cut-off, Strehl ratio (SR) and a simulated contrast visual acuity-optical quality analysis system value (OV) obtained by a double-pass system with a 4-mm aperture. Subjective visual acuity was measured as secondary outcome. All the patients were followed up for 3 months.

The purpose of this study was to investigate risk factors associated with development of clinically significant posterior capsule opacification requiring yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) capsulotomy.
Medical records of patients (≥18 years) who underwent cataract surgery between January 1, 2011, and March 31, 2014, at Kresge Eye Institute were reviewed. Three hundred eyes requiring YAG capsulotomy up to 3 years after cataract surgery were included in the YAG capsulotomy group. Three hundred eyes not requiring YAG capsulotomy up to 3 years after cataract surgery were selected via age-matched simple randomization (control group).
The YAG capsulotomy group included patients with younger age (65.8 ± 11.3 vs. 70.1 ± 10.6 years, P < .001), more men (42.67 vs. 34.67%, P = .04), fewer patients with hypertension (73.00 vs. 83.00%, P < .001), and more patients with hydrophilic intraocular lenses (74.67 vs. 47.00%, P < .001). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated a negative association between YAG capsulotomy and age (coefficient, -0.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95 to 0.98; P < .001) and hydrophobic intraocular lenses (coefficient, -1.50; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.33; P < .001), and a positive association with presence of glaucoma (coefficient, 0.88; 95% CI, 1.39 to 4.17; P = .002).

Literature searches were conducted in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and the databases of clinical trials in February 2019, without date or language restrictions. The search resulted in 194 potentially relevant citations, and 34 were selected for full-text review. Fourteen studies were determined to be relevant to the assessment criteria and were selected for inclusion in this assessment. The panel methodologist then assigned a level of evidence rating to these studies.
Intraocular lenses were associated with visual outcomes similar to outcomes for contact lenses or spectacles for children who had both bilateral and unilateral cataracts. Intraocular lenses were also associated with an increased risk of visual axis opacities. All treatments were associated with a similar incidence of glaucoma. Although ocular growth was similar for all treatments, infants younger than 6 months who underwent IOL implantation had large myopic shifts that often resulted in high myopia or severe anisometropia later in childhood. Corneal endothelial cell counts were lower in eyes that underwent IOL implantation. The incidence of strabismus was similar with all treatments.
Intraocular lens implantation is not recommended for children 6 months of age or younger because there is a higher incidence of visual axis opacities with this treatment compared with aphakia. The best available evidence suggests that IOL implantation can be done safely with acceptable side effects in children older than 6 months of age. However, the unpredictability of ocular growth means that these children will often have large refractive errors later in childhood that may necessitate an IOL exchange or wearing spectacles or contact lenses with a large refractive correction. In addition, the training and experience of the surgeon as well as ocular and systemic comorbidities should be taken into consideration when deciding whether IOL implantation would be appropriate.";;;Intraocular lenses were associated with visual outcomes similar to outcomes for contact lenses or spectacles for children who had both bilateral and unilateral cataracts.

Retrospective single-center case series of 31 eyes of 28 patients who underwent surgery between 2007 and 2016. Visual outcomes, early and late complications were analyzed. The refractive measurements were also assessed using a portable refractometer in prone and face-down position for each patient. The spherical equivalents were then compared.

This triple procedure has several benefits, which include a shorter period of visual disability and less cost to the patient than the 2-stage technique. There have been attempts to combine phacoemulsification and deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) to maximize the advantages of both procedures in a single sitting. Some authors suggest a triple procedure in which the big-bubble DALK technique is performed before phacoemulsification; however, they recommend that phacoemulsification be performed with extreme caution to prevent Descemet membrane rupture.

Sutureless transconjunctival intrascleral haptic fixated intraocular lens implantation was performed in patients with aphakia and dislocated intraocular lenses. A clear corneal incision (2.8 mm) was made into the temporal quadrant and a three-piece intraocular lens was implanted into the anterior chamber. The haptics of the intraocular lens were externalized with a 27 G needle via transconjunctival scleral tunnels at the 6 and 12 o'clock positions. The transconjunctival scleral tunnels were prepared to conform to the haptic position and curvature. The site of the scleral tunnels was 2mm from the limbus with a length of 2 mm in the sclera and was aimed at the end of the posterior chamber. The tips of the haptics were cauterized to create a terminal knob. The haptics were pushed back and the knobs were implanted into the scleral tunnels.

Cataract surgeries in anterior megalophthalmos can be challenging due to the anatomical anomalies while the studies upon the surgical design have been less integrated.
A 37-year-old woman presented with progressively blurred vision in the right eye after a transient fever 10 months ago. Her ocular history included hypermetropia with a spherical equivalent of + 4.00 OU. The review of systems showed bilateral varus deformity of distal interphalangeal joints on the little fingers. The patient denied family history of hereditary ocular diseases and her sister was born with uterus didelphys. On initial examinations, the corrected distance visual acuity was hand motion OD and 20/33 OS. Her intraocular pressure was 15 mmHg OD and 16 mmHg OS. Horizontal corneal diameter was 14 mm OD and 13.88 mm OS and axial length was 24.87 mm OD and 25 mm OS. Anterior segment photography showed bilateral iridal atrophy with deficiency in pupillary dilation and white cortically mature cataract in the right eye. Inspection by anterior segment optical coherence tomography indicated bilateral augmented anterior chambers with backward iridal concave on horizontal orientation. Ultrasound biomicroscopy showed partially peripheral anterior synechiae and pectinate ligaments at chamber angle in both eyes and opacified lens with the apparently elongated suspensory ligaments in the right eye. A deliberately selected 1-piece foldable intraocular lens (IOL) with frame haptics was implanted after phacoemulsification for good IOL stability. During the follow-up, the visual rehabilitation appeared relatively good and a lower degree of IOL dislocation comparing with existing reports was verified by OPD-Scan III aberrometry.
We presented the challenges and the original findings from a case of congenital anterior megalophthalmos with white cataract who underwent phacoemulsification and IOL implantation. This is the first report describing the comparison of the different IOL power calculation formulas in anterior megalophthalmos. Compared to the SRK/T and the Holladay II formulas, the Haigis formula could be a more accurate choice for the IOL calculation in anterior megalophthalmos according to our case.

These include placement of an IOL within the capsular bag with a capsular tension ring, a scleral-fixated posterior-chamber IOL (PCIOL) with or without capsular tension segment or ring, an intra-scleral fixated IOL, an iris-sutured PCIOL, or an anterior chamber iris-fixated IOL. We reviewed 48 articles and 1 published abstract describing the surgical techniques, complications and visual outcomes of different IOL options in the management of aphakic pediatric eyes with insufficient capsular support. The present review found that the visual acuity outcomes of various IOLs are comparable. Furthermore, each IOL design and surgical technique has different rates of serious complications, including IOL dislocation or decentration, intraocular hemorrhage, glaucoma, endothelial cell loss, and endophthalmitis.

IOL power calculation was done using the Double-K formula of Aramberri. The preoperative versus postoperative corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) and the uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) values were used to assess the efficacy and safety of the surgery; meanwhile, the achieved versus the expected refractive outcomes postoperatively were used to assess the predictability.

163;30971816;Risk of aphakic glaucoma after pars plana-lensectomy with and without removal of the peripheral lens capsule.;[];Eye (London, England);"The etiology of aphakic glaucoma is unclear. It has been suggested that remaining lens epithelium releases cytokines transducing trabecular meshwork cells. Therefore, we compared two cohorts of children undergoing lensectomy. In cohort 1, the entire lens including its capsule was removed, in cohort 2 the peripheral lens capsule was left intact, also to facilitate secondary intraocular lens implantation later on.
We included children with uni- or bilateral congenital cataract who underwent lensectomy during the first year of life with subsequent contact lenses fitting. Group 1 comprised 41 eyes, group 2 comprised 33 eyes. In group 1, the median age at surgery was 4.0 months in unilateral and 3.0 months in bilateral cases 1, in group 2, 8.1 months and 2.4 months, respectively. The mean follow-up was 12.8 years in group 1 and 9.3 years in group 2. All cases were analyzed for the prevalence of aphakic glaucoma, for visual acuity and for compliance in visual rehabilitation (contact lens/occlusion therapy).
We found no significant difference in glaucoma prevalence between group 1 and group 2 (p = 0.68). The overall glaucoma rate was 26% after the mean follow-up of 11 years in both groups. In unilateral cases, the median visual acuity was logMAR 0.7 in both groups. In bilateral cases it was logMAR 0.4 in group 1 and logMAR 0.2 in group 2 (p = 0.05).

164;30970023;Five-year follow-up of secondary iris-claw intraocular lens implantation for the treatment of aphakia: Anterior chamber versus retropupillary implantation.;[];PloS one;"Though several procedures of IOL implantation have been described (sutured scleral fixation, intra-scleral fixation, angle-supported anterior chamber, and anterior chamber or retropupillary iris-claw IOLs), there are no randomized trials which are comparing different techniques. Hence, the surgical treatment of aphakia still remains controversial and challenging. The purpose of this study was to compare the long-term efficacy and the rate of complications of anterior versus posterior Iris-claw intraocular lenses (IOL) implantation to correct for the treatment of aphakia without sufficient capsule support.
Consecutive eyes having secondary implantation of aphakic iris-fixated IOLs with a follow-up of at least 5 years were considered. Mean correct distance visual acuity (CDVA) changes, percentage of eyes with CDVA improvement, mean corneal endothelial cell density (CECD) loss and the rate of other complications were used for statistical analysis. The study evaluated a total of 180 eyes (Group A: 87 anterior chamber iris-claw fixation, Group B: 93 retropupillary iris-claw implantation) of 180 consecutive different patients, with aphakia of various reasons. CDVA improved significantly in both groups after surgery (P<0.001, ANOVA), and was remarkably higher than baseline in both groups from first week and during the entire follow-up (P<0.001, Tukey's Honest Significant Difference). There was no statistically significant difference in CDVA between the two groups during each follow-up visits (P = NS, unpaired t-test) and in the CDVA improvement percentage between the two groups (P = 0.882, Chi-square test). No significant changes in CECD were noted after surgery in both groups (ANOVA Group A: P = 0.067, Group B: P = 0.330P). No intra-operative complications occurred in both groups. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of complications between the two groups (P = NS, Chi-square test), except for pigment precipitates which were higher in Group A (P<0.05, Chi-square test).
Five-year follow-up shows that secondary implantation of aphakic IOLs is effective and safe for the correction treatment of aphakia in eyes without capsule support.";;;;;10.1371/journal.pone.0214140;2019-04-11;[{'lastname': 'Toro', 'firstname': 'Mario Damiano', 'initials': 'MD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.\nDepartment of General Ophthalmology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Longo', 'firstname': 'Antonio', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Avitabile', 'firstname': 'Teresio', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Nowomiejska', 'firstname': 'Katarzyna', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Ophthalmology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.\nInstitute for Ophthalmic Research, University Eye Hospital, Tuebingen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Gagliano', 'firstname': 'Caterina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Tripodi', 'firstname': 'Sarah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Choragiewicz', 'firstname': 'Tomasz', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Ophthalmology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Kaminska', 'firstname': 'Agnieszka', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Medicine, Collegium Medicum, Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University, Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Figus', 'firstname': 'Michele', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgical, Medical, Molecular Pathology and of the Critical Area, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Posarelli', 'firstname': 'Chiara', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgical, Medical, Molecular Pathology and of the Critical Area, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Forlini', 'firstname': 'Matteo', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Ophthalmology, University of Parma, Parma, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Jünemann', 'firstname': 'Anselm Gerhard Maria', 'initials': 'AGM', 'affiliation': 'Department for Ophthalmology, University Medicine Rostock, Rostock, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Reibaldi', 'firstname': 'Michele', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Rejdak', 'firstname': 'Robert', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Ophthalmology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.'}]

In this randomized clinical trial, 104 patients were randomly assigned to IOL repositioning by scleral suturing (n = 54) or IOL exchange with a retropupillary iris-claw lens (n = 50). A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) was performed in conjunction with previously published 6-month efficacy and safety results. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated as the cost difference between the operation groups relative to their difference in postoperative corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) (mean and 95% confidence interval: minimum and maximum), reported as the cost difference in United States Dollars ($) per logMAR difference.
Exchange surgery was $281.20 ± 17.66 more expensive than repositioning, mainly explained by the new IOL and the frequent use of anterior vitrectomy. A previous trial publication revealed no significant difference in the 6-month postoperative CDVA between the groups. In the CEA, the mean group difference yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of -$281.20 per -0.11 logMAR (-$1108/QALY) in favour of repositioning, ranging from -$281.20 per -0.29 logMAR (-$406/QALY) in favour of repositioning to +$281.20 per -0.08 logMAR (+$1522/QALY) in favour of exchange. The CEA did not include the mean 9.5 min shorter operation time for exchange.
Repositioning tended to be more cost-effective than exchange; however, this is modified if also considering the operation time. Overall, it seems the cost-effectiveness is not alone sufficiently different to recommend one of the operation methods over the other for late in-the-bag IOL dislocation.";"Repositioning tended to be more cost-effective than exchange; however, this is modified if also considering the operation time.

A retrospective comparative study of a consecutive series of 210 participants above 18 years of age diagnosed with significant cataract and who required glaucoma surgery, namely, Ex-Press miniature glaucoma device implantation or cataract alone in one or both eyes. All were operated on by a single experienced glaucoma surgeon in a single medical center. A total of 231 eyes were included in this study. All cases underwent an uneventful surgery and were examined the day following the surgery for visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and signs of excessive anterior chamber inflammation (Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature grading ⩾ 3).
The combined group included 55 eyes of 51 patients, of whom 15 (27.3%) demonstrated excessive anterior chamber inflammation. The phacoemulsification group included 176 eyes of 159 patients, of whom 12 (6.7%) demonstrated excessive anterior chamber inflammation. Visual acuity and intraocular pressure measurements showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups.

169;30933995;The role of primary intraocular lens implantation in the risk of secondary glaucoma following congenital cataract surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis.;[];PloS one;"This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the incidence of secondary glaucoma in patients under the age of 2 years who underwent congenital cataract surgery with or without primary intraocular lens (IOL) implantation.
An electronic literature search was performed in Medline, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases to retrieve studies between January 2011 and November 2018. Patients with congenital cataract who did primary IOL implantation, aphakia, or secondary IOL implantation followed by receiving extraction surgery were included in this study. Relevant studies meeting defined eligibility criteria were selected and reviewed systematically by meta-analysis. Long-term incidences of secondary glaucoma, which developed at least one year after cataract surgery, were considered and discussed as clinical outcomes in each cohort. The pooled data were analyzed according to a random effects model.
Eight publications involving 892 eyes were included in the current meta-analysis. In the general population of eyes with congenital cataract, the long-term incidence of secondary glaucoma was lower (P = 0.06) in eyes with primary IOL (9.5%) than in eyes without primary IOL (15.1%), including aphakia and secondary IOL. The pooled risk ratio (RR) favors primary IOL implantation in all patients (RR = 0.63). For bilateral congenital cataract, the incidence was 6.7% in eyes with primary IOL implantation, which is significantly lower than the 16.7% in eyes with aphakia and secondary IOL implantation (P<0.05, RR = 0.44). However, for unilateral congenital cataract surgery, the incidence was very similar in eyes with and without primary IOL (12.4% vs 12.0%, P = 0.61, RR = 0.87).

Lens-refilling surgery is a potential therapeutic intervention to treat patients with a cataract lens. The lens material is replaced with an injectable (bio)polymer that retains the natural mechanical and optical lens properties, therewith allowing accommodation. The occurrence of capsular opacification mediated by lens epithelial cells negatively affects accommodation and vision and should be avoided in this lens restoration approach.
An in vivo rabbit animal model was used with lens replacement with a silicone-based gel-like polymer and concurrent treatment of the lens epithelium with drugs. A case-study approach was applied as both drug combinations and implantation times were varied. The following drugs were investigated for their potential to prevent capsular opacification long-term: actinomycin D, methotrexate, paclitaxel and Tween-20. All were administered in a hyaluronic acid vehicle. The rabbits were clinically followed for periods up to 4 years postimplantation. Eyes, corneas and lenses were analysed post-mortem using MRI and confocal microscopy.
Treatment combinations containing actinomycin D generally led to the least appearance of capsular fibrosis. The use of Tween-20 or paclitaxel without actinomycin D resulted in much earlier and pronounced fibrotic responses. The aspect of capsular opacification was highly variable in individual animals. Application of the drugs in a hyaluronic acid vehicle appeared to be a safe method that spared the corneal endothelium.

In Case 1, there was an unexpected hyperopic postoperative spherical equivalent refractive error of +1.50 diopters and in Case 2, a cylindrical refractive error of 2.75 diopter cylinder. We examine the possible causes of error and discuss potential management strategies to prevent and address these unpredictable postoperative outcomes. The importance of comprehensive and careful ocular surface assessment before cataract or refractive surgery as part of the presurgical workup is reemphasized. EBMD can be subtle and if overlooked, can affect the validity of biometric keratometric measurements preoperatively, resulting in an inaccurate biometry measurement, incorrect IOL selection, and reduced visual performance and patient satisfaction.;;;;Copyright © 2019 ASCRS and ESCRS.

Custom IOLs (cIOLs) were calculated for twelve normal and twelve keratoconic eyes using personalized numerical ray tracing models. The Stiles-Crawford weighted root-mean-square spot-size (wRMS) at the virtual fovea was evaluated for cIOLs and aberration-neutral IOLs (nIOLs) in a simulated clinical study with 500 virtual IOL implantations per eye and per IOL. IOL misalignment (decentration, tilt, rotation) and pupillary ectopia (4.5 mm iris aperture) were varied upon each virtual implantation. The nIOLs achieved average wRMS of 16.4 ± 4.3 μm for normal, and 92.7 ± 34.4 μm for keratoconic eyes (mean ± standard deviation). The cIOLs reduced the average wRMS to 10.3 ± 5.8 μm for normal, and 28.5 ± 18.6 μm for keratoconic eyes. The cIOLs produced smaller wRMS than nIOLs in most virtual implantations (86.7% for normal and 99.4% for keratoconic eyes). IOL misalignment resulted in larger wRMS variations in the keratoconus group than in the normal group.

This condition is an acute decompensation of eye hydrodynamics, which develops with primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG). Detectability of PACG is only high at the sudden development of an acute attack, which can cause a sharp decrease or even irreversible loss of vision.
To assess the effectiveness of predicting the development of PACG in eyes with short anterior-posterior axis.
The study included 69 patients (90 eyes) aged 46 to 80 years with short anterior-posterior axis. We used our own mathematical formulas for calculating the risk of PACG development. According to these formulas, two groups of patients with high risk of PACG were selected. Patients of the main group underwent cataract phacoemulsification for preventive purposes, while patients of the comparison group did not undergo any operative treatment.
In the long-term, PACG did not develop in the patients of the main group. Patients of the comparison group refused to undergo cataract phacoemulsification, and had PACG develop in 38% of cases in the long-term follow-up.
The high efficiency of the developed screening model for estimating the risk of PACG developing in eyes with short anterior-posterior axis has been proved. Preventive cataract phacoemulsification in the eyes with a high risk of PACG development in all cases helped to avoid it, retaining and even improving visual functions.

To evaluate the achieved refraction and its relation to the anterior-posterior axis of pseudophakic eyes after extraction of CC in children of up to one year of age.
The study included 115 children (159 eyes) examined 1 to 11 years after the extraction of bilateral or unilateral CC at the age of 2-11 months. Optical power of the implanted IOL had been calculated using SRKII formula for hypercorrection to result in emmetropic or weak myopic refraction by the time the eye growth finishes. The subjects underwent autorefractometry on Retinomax K-Plus 3 device and ultrasonic biometry on Humphrey 835 A/B-scan system.
The incidence of unplanned refraction in children aged 1 to 3 years was 61.2%, aged 3 years to 5 years 11 months - 24.4%, and in children of 6-11 years - 50.0%; it was associated with pronounced unplanned eye growth in 48.6% of cases with bilateral CC and in 27.3% of cases with unilateral CC.
The main cause of unplanned refraction in pseudophakic eyes in children with CC is unpredictable increase of the length of anterior-posterior axis after surgery.

Past medical history was registered and a complete ophthalmologic evaluation, that included best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp examination and fundoscopy, was performed. Anterior segment photographs were taken whenever intraocular lens opacification was present.
One hundred and sixty-nine eyes of 154 patients were included, mean age 78.5 ± 7.9 years. The average follow-up after intraocular lens implantation was 65.6 ± 10.0 months.

However, although it is easier to perform than scleral fixation, it presents some critical issues related to the enclavation procedure. The success of the correct enclavation without excessive surgical manipulations, with subsequent pigment dispersion and without pupil distortion, is highly related to the surgical skills of the individual surgeon. The new technique proposed by the authors consists of using a guide needle to facilitate the enclavation, and to make this surgical procedure standard.

Both the anterior and total corneal primary spherical aberrations were lower in the high myopia group than that in the control group (0.317 ± 0.215 vs 0.338 ± 0.148 μm, P = 0.043; and 0.281 ± 0.207 vs 0.314 ± 0.153 μm, P < 0.001). The incidence of eyes with negative total corneal primary spherical aberration increased as axial length increased in the high myopia group, and the overall incidence was higher in the high myopia group than that in the control group (2.59% vs 1.47%). These were mainly contributed to the younger age of cataract patients with high myopia (55.76 ± 13.10 vs 60.18 ± 15.72 years, P < 0.001), along with the positive correlations between age and anterior and total corneal primary spherical aberrations. In clinical practice, an aspheric IOL with a low negative or zero primary spherical aberration is recommended for cataract patients with high myopia.

To comparatively analyze the clinical and functional effectiveness of bifocal IOLs implanted during combined cataract and glaucoma surgery.
The prospective study included 41 patients (75 eyes) with presbyopia and POAG who underwent one-stage cataract phacoemulsification with implantation of a multifocal IOL and non-penetrating deep sclerectomy (NPDS) with lens capsule. Group 1 included 24 patients (44 eyes) with implantation of diffractive-refractive IOL. Group 2 consisted of 17 patients (31 eyes) who were implanted aspheric diffractive IOL with asymmetric optics.
Mean IOP in both groups was 18.1±2.9 mmHg, and the difference with the preoperative parameters (26.1±2.8) was statistically significant (p<0.05). On average, the patients received 1.3±0.5 antihypertensive drugs compared to 2.4±0.61 before surgery (0.05<p<0.1). Near uncorrected visual acuity (nUCVA) in group 1 was 0.51±0.12 (p=0.009), in group 2 - 0.53±0.1 (p=0.01). Distant uncorrected visual acuity (dUCVA) was 0.59±0.09 (p=0.043) In group 1, and 0.57±0.04 (p=0.021) in group 2. Near best corrected visual acuity (nBCVA) in group 1 was 0.64±0.07, and 0.64±0.09 in group 2. In all studied groups postoperative nBCVA after 1 year of observation was significantly higher than before the surgery (p=0.006 and p=0.009 respectively).
The main study goal (dBCVA=1.0 at 1 year after surgery) was achieved in 31.8% of cases in group 1 and in 29.1% of cases in group 2 (p>0.1). Implantation of multifocal IOLs in combination cataract and glaucoma surgery is a safe and effective surgical intervention for the described group of patients.
В настоящее время остается дискутабельным вопрос о целесообразности имплантации мультифокальной интраокулярной линзы (ИОЛ) у пациентов с первичной открытоугольной глаукомой (ПОУГ). Цель - сравнительный анализ клинико-функциональных результатов имплантации бифокальных ИОЛ в ходе комбинированной хирургии катаракты и глаукомы. Материал и методы. В проспективное открытое исследование вошел 41 пациент (75 глаз) с пресбиопией и ПОУГ, которым проведена одномоментная факоэмульсификация катаракты с имплантацией мультифокальных ИОЛ и непроникающей глубокой склерэктомией с дренированием собственной капсулой хрусталика. В 1-ю группу вошли 24 пациента (44 глаза) с имплантацией дифракционно-рефракционной ИОЛ, во 2-ю - 17 пациентов (31 глаз), которым имплантировали дифракционную асферичную ИОЛ с асимметричной оптикой.

The present study shows for the first time an age-increased OS-induced protein damage (protein carbonyl formation) in the AH and LECs/capsule of CAT patients with PEX, POAG or PXG. The slow rate of change of protein carbonyls strongly suggests a long-term implication of OS in ocular disease pathogenesis. Additionally, protein concentration levels in the AH of CAT patients increase independently of age, and in same as with protein carbonyls increasing order levels for CAT<POAG<PXG in AH and LECs/capsule. This may suggest a protein cross-diffusion taking place between AH and LECs/capsule, most likely originating from PEX deposition and/or necrotic/apoptotic LECs/capsule. Moreover, the findings of the present study establish the use of protein carbonyls (together with a methodology for their more accurate quantification, which overcomes serious unreliability problems of past methods) as an age accumulative marker of OS damage, for future studies that investigate long-term OS involvement in pseudoexfoliative ocular disorders.";;;;;;2019-02-05;[{'lastname': 'Papadopoulou', 'firstname': 'Garyfallia', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology, University of Patras, Patras, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Zisimopoulos', 'firstname': 'Dimitrios', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology, University of Patras, Patras, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Kalaitzopoulou', 'firstname': 'Electra', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology, University of Patras, Patras, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Makri', 'firstname': 'Olga Ε', 'initials': 'OΕ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Patras, Patras, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Tsapardoni', 'firstname': 'Foteini N', 'initials': 'FN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Patras, Patras, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Georgakopoulos', 'firstname': 'Constantinos D', 'initials': 'CD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Patras, Patras, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Georgiou', 'firstname': 'Christos D', 'initials': 'CD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology, University of Patras, Patras, Greece.'}]
212;30709087;Hospital Choice for Cataract Treatments: The Winner Takes Most.;['Hospital Demand', 'Patient Choice', 'Quality Competition', 'Quality Indicators'];International journal of health policy and management;"Transparency in quality of care is an increasingly important issue in healthcare. In many international healthcare systems, transparency in quality is crucial for health insurers when purchasing care on behalf of their consumers, for providers to improve the quality of care (if necessary), and for consumers to choose their provider in case treatment is needed. Conscious consumer choices incentivize healthcare providers to deliver better quality of care. This paper studies the impact of quality on patient volume and hospital choice, and more specifically whether high quality providers are able to attract more patients.
The dataset covers the period 2006-2011 and includes all patients who underwent a cataract treatment in the Netherlands. We first estimate the impact of quality on volume using a simple ordinary least squares (OLS), second we use a mixed logit to determine how patients make trade-offs between quality, distance and waiting time in provider choice.
At the aggregate-level we find that, a one-point quality increase, on a scale of one to a hundred, raises patient volume for the average hospital by 2-4 percent. This effect is mainly driven by the hospital with the highest quality score: the effect halves after excluding this hospital from the dataset. Also at the individual-level, all else being equal, patients have a stronger preference for the hospital with the highest quality score, and appear indifferent between the remaining hospitals.
Our results suggest that the top performing hospital is able to attract significantly more patients than the remaining hospitals. We find some evidence that a small share of consumers may respond to quality differences, thereby contributing to incentives for providers to invest in quality and for insurers to take quality into account in the purchasing strategy.";Our results suggest that the top performing hospital is able to attract significantly more patients than the remaining hospitals.

A total of 800 patients were examined before cataract surgery in 1997-1998. Twenty years later, 100 of 133 survivors (75%) participated in the follow-up. An eye examination was performed including assessment for pseudophakodonesis and dislocation of the IOL. The medical records of all included patients at baseline were studied. Main outcome measures were previous IOL exchange or repositioning surgery, significant IOL dislocation, degree of pseudophakodonesis, and visual acuity.
Twenty years after the original cataract surgery, 10 of the 800 patients at risk (1.2%) had needed dislocation surgery. Before cataract surgery, 39% of all patients had pseudoexfoliations (PXF). Mean time from cataract surgery to dislocation surgery was 12 years 6 months (range 3 years 9 months to 19 years 3 months). The cumulative incidence over 20 years was 6% in patients with PXF and 2% without PXF at surgery (P = .035). Mean age at cataract surgery in the 10 dislocated cases was 68.3 years (range 58-80). Twenty years after surgery, 5 of 98 (5%) patients had moderate/pronounced pseudophakodonesis.
In this population-based cohort, the 20-year cumulative incidence of IOL dislocation needing surgical attention was significantly higher in patients with PXF than without PXF before surgery. The individual patient seems to have a low risk of being affected by this complication, but dislocated IOLs may cause a relatively large public health care burden, because of the large number of people in society with previous cataract surgery.";;;Twenty years after the original cataract surgery, 10 of the 800 patients at risk (1.2%) had needed dislocation surgery.

A retrospective cohort study.
A review of the registry of operations between the years 2007 and 2016 was carried out at the Ophthalmology Unit of Kymenlaakso Central Hospital, Kotka, Finland. A total of 10 044 eyes having cataract surgery and in-the-bag implantation of ZCB00 (Abbott Medical Optics Johnson & Johnson Vision, Inc, Abbott Park, Illinois, USA), SN60WF (Alcon Laboratories, Inc, Fort Worth, Texas, USA), or ZA9003 (Abbott Medical Optics Johnson & Johnson Vision, Inc) IOLs were included in the study. The cumulative incidence of Nd:YAG capsulotomy was estimated with competing risks methodology. Competing risks regression modeling was used to evaluate potential risk factors, including the patient's age, sex, type of IOL, dioptric power of IOL, and operating surgeon's seniority.
The 5-year cumulative incidence of Nd:YAG capsulotomy after cataract surgery was 13.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.5%-14.0%) for all eyes and 18.1% (16.5%-20.0%), 11.5% (10.5%-12.6%), and 9.6% (8.2%-11.4%) for ZCB00, SN60WF, and ZA9003 IOLs, respectively.

Nonetheless, serious postoperative complications related to inadequate vault have been previously reported. Therefore, lens exchange is advised when the vault is out of the recommended ranges. This article presents a case with persistent low vault after lens exchange in which no clinical evidence of crystalline lens opacity or decrease in uncorrected distance visual acuity has been identified during the 6-year clinical follow-up performed to date.

Preparations were secured by pinning the ciliary body to a silicone ring and maintaining in 6 mL serum-free EMEM for 28 days or in a graded culture system (days 1-3, 5% human serum and 10 ng/mL TGFβ2; days 4-7, 2% human serum and 1 ng/mL TGFβ2; days 8-14, 1% human serum and 0.1 ng/mL TGFβ2; days 15-28, serum-free EMEM), which better mimics clinical changes. Preparations were monitored with phase-contrast and modified-dark-field microscopy. Cell coverage and light scatter were quantified using image analysis software. The transdifferentiation marker, α-SMA and matrix component, fibronectin were assessed by immunocytochemistry. To assess IOLs in the model, Alcon Acrysof or Hoya Vivinex IOLs were implanted in match-paired capsular bags.
Match-paired experiments showed that graded culture enhanced growth, facilitated matrix contraction, increased transdifferentiation, and promoted matrix deposition relative to serum-free culture. The graded culture protocol was applied to match-paired bags implanted with a Hoya Vivinex or an Alcon Acrysof IOL. The Vivinex demonstrated a lag in growth across the posterior capsule. However, by day 28, coverage was similar, but light-scatter was greater with Acrysof implanted. Cell growth on the Acrysof IOL anterior surface was significantly greater than Vivinex.
The graded culture human capsular bag model serves as an excellent system to evaluate and develop intraocular lenses. The Hoya Vivinex IOL showed an overall better level of performance against postsurgical wound healing and PCO than the Alcon Acrysof using this model.";;;;;10.1167/iovs.18-25930;2019-01-11;[{'lastname': 'Eldred', 'firstname': 'Julie A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'School of Biological Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Zheng', 'firstname': 'Jiyun', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'HOYA Surgical Optics, Disruptive Target Research Group, Global R&D, Singapore.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Sulin', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'HOYA Surgical Optics, Disruptive Target Research Group, Global R&D, Singapore.'}, {'lastname': 'Wormstone', 'firstname': 'I Michael', 'initials': 'IM', 'affiliation': 'School of Biological Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom.'}]

227;30616288;Evaluation of Visual Comfort and Mental Effort Under Different Light Conditions for Ultraviolet-Absorbing and Additional Blue-Filtering Intraocular Lenses for Cataract Surgery.;[];Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde;"Patients with an ultraviolet blocking lens (UV) (n = 5) or blue filter lens (BB) (n = 8) after intraocular lens (IOL) replacement for cataract and age-adjusted controls (AACs) (n = 16) underwent a balanced crossover within-subject design. After 1.5 h of dark adaptation, they were exposed to polychromatic light at 6500 K (blue-enriched) and 2500 K and 3000 K (non-blue-enriched) for 2 hours in the evening. Visual comfort and mental effort were repeatedly assessed by the Visual Analogue Scale (0 - 100) and the Visual Comfort and Mental Effort Rating Scale (0 - 100) for each light condition. The results were compared using mixed model analysis.
The mean (± SD) age for AAC and patients with UV or BB was 69.8 ± 6.2 y, 70.8 ± 4 y, and 63.6 ± 5.6 y, respectively. Irrespective of the light condition, patients with UV and BB felt mentally more tired during the experiments compared to AACs (F = 6.15, p = 0.003). However, patients with BB were mentally more motivated to perform the exercises compared to patients with UV and AACs (F = 8.1, p < 0.001). Patients with BB perceived ambient light as less glary (F = 4.71, p = 0.01) than patients with UV. Blue ambient light was felt less intensely in patients with BB (F = 2.51, p = 0.042) compared to those with UV and the AACs.
Lens replacement in older cataract patients may increase visual comfort and minimize mental effort. While subtle, the magnitude of these effects may depend on the type of intraocular lens. BB intraocular lenses may have potential benefits, as ambient light is perceived as having less glare and less visual tension.
Bei schwierigen Lichtverhältnissen ist der visuelle Komfort beeinträchtigt und die mentale Anstrengung beim Sehen erhöht; besonders gilt dies für Kataraktpatienten. Unterschiedliche Intraokularlinsen stehen bei der Kataraktoperation zur Verfügung: die regulären ultraviolettblockierenden (UV) und Intraokularlinsen mit zusätzlichem Blaufilter (BB). Die intrinsischen photosensitiven retinalen Zellen sind hochsensitiv für blaues Licht. Blaues Licht beeinflusst daher die visuelle Funktion. Das Ziel der Studie war der Vergleich des visuellen Komforts und der mentalen Anstrengung bei Patienten mit UV gegenüber solchen mit BB im Vergleich zu einer altersadaptierten Kontrollgruppe (AAC).
Patienten mit AAC (n = 16) sowie UV (n = 5) und BB (n = 8) nach Kataraktoperation wurden in eine ausgewogene Cross-over-Studie eingeschlossen. Nach 1,5 h Dunkeladaption erfolgte im Labor die Exposition für 2 h bei blau angereichertem polychromatischem Umgebungslicht bei 6500 K (Kandula), nicht blau angereichertem Licht bei 2500 bzw. 3000 K. Für jedes Umgebungslicht wurde bei jeder Testserie erneut der Fragebogen zum visuellen Komfort und der mentalen Anstrengung (Visual Comfort und Mental Effort Rating Scale) ausgefüllt. Die Antworten wurden jeweils auf einer visuellen Analogskala von 0 – 100 eingetragen. Die statische Auswertung erfolgte mittels Mixed-Model-Analyse.
Das mittlere Alter von AAC und Patienten mit UV oder BB war 69,8 ± 6,2, 70,8 ± 4, 63,6 ± 5,6 Jahre. Unabhängig vom Umgebungslicht empfanden Patienten mit UV und BB die Tests als ermüdender im Vergleich zu den Patienten mit AAC (F = 6,15, p = 0,003). Die Patienten mit BB waren motivierter, die Tests durchzuführen, bei blau angereichertem Umgebungslicht im Vergleich zu den Patienten mit UV und AAC (F = 8,1, p < 0,001). Patienten mit BB haben die Umgebungslichter als weniger blendend wahrgenommen als die Patienten mit UV (F = 4,71, p = 0,01). Blau angereichertes Umgebungslicht wurde als weniger nervös machend wahrgenommen bei Patienten mit BB (F = 2,51, p = 0,042) verglichen mit Patienten mit UV und AAC.
Obwohl der visuelle Komfort und die mentale Anstrengung zwischen BB und UV in den meisten Aspekten vergleichbar ist, unterscheiden sich die Patientengruppen in ausgewählten Aspekten. BB sind möglicherweise vorteilhaft, da das Umgebungslicht als weniger blendend empfunden wird und weniger mentale Anspannung für das Sehen erforderlich ist.";Lens replacement in older cataract patients may increase visual comfort and minimize mental effort.

Prospective, randomized, parallel group, active controlled trial.
Patients with PACG.
A total of 120 consecutive patients with PACG were screened, of whom 80 met inclusion criteria, with PACG uncontrolled on maximal hypotensive therapy and were recruited. Patients were randomized into 2 groups and underwent phaco alone in group 1 or phacoGSL in group 2. The patients were examined at baseline and at 1 week and 1, 3, and 6 months. The anterior chamber angle parameters on swept-source anterior segment OCT (SS-ASOCT) were noted at 1 and 6 months.
The primary outcome measure was intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction. A reduction in IOP of ≥ 20% from baseline IOP with or without medications was considered a success. Secondary outcome measures included change in the anterior chamber angle temporal parameters, angle-opening distance, trabecular-iris space area and scleral spur angle, surgical safety, visual acuity, and reduction in the number of glaucoma medications postoperatively.
The average age of patients was 58.77±8.14 years and 56.50±9.17 years in groups 1 and 2, respectively (P = 0.31). The mean baseline IOP was 29.48±6.76 mmHg and 30.72±3.88 mmHg in groups 1 and 2, respectively (P = 0.13). Success was obtained in 93.33% of patients in group 1 and 91.18% of patients in group 2 at 6 months (P = 0.39). Mean IOP was 13.17±1.66 mmHg and 13.21±1.97 mmHg at 6 months in groups 1 and 2, respectively (P = 0.001). The reduction in IOP was 55.32% and 56.99% at 6 months in groups 1 and 2 (P = 0.48). Significant widening of the angle parameters was noted at 6 months with an increase compared with baseline values in both groups. In multivariate analysis, the significant predictor of decrease in IOP was the higher baseline IOP.
Both phaco and phacoGSL are associated with a significant reduction in IOP along with a noteworthy widening of the anterior chamber angle parameters.

230;30593159;Comparison of refractive outcomes between femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery and conventional cataract surgery.;[];Medicine;The purpose of our study is to compare the predictive accuracy of femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery with the results of conventional cataract surgery. This prospective study included 83 eyes from 83 patients who underwent femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery and 83 eyes from 83 patients who underwent conventional cataract surgery. Preoperative IOL power calculations were performed with the partical coherence interferometry. Femtosecond laser-assisted capsulotomy was based on 5.2 mm scanned capsule center. Following phacoemulsification, 1-piece IOL was inserted into the capsular bag. Refractive outcome was measured 3 months postoperatively with manual refraction. Predicted refraction was assessed by the Barret-Universal II, Haigis, Hoffer Q, SRK/T, and T2 formulas. We applied optimized IOL constants and retrospectively personalized IOL constants. There was no difference in preoperative demographic data. When the optimized IOL constants were used, the femtosecond laser-assisted group produced significantly lower MAEs in the Barret-Universal II, Hoffer Q, SRK/T, and T2 formulas (P < .05). After the personalization of IOL constants, there were statistical differences in the Barret-Universal II, Hoffer Q (P < .05). The standard deviation of ME and MedAE were also relatively lower with femtosecond laser-assisted group. In conclusion, femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery with Catalys femtosecond laser system produced better refractive outcomes than conventional cataract surgery.;;;;;10.1097/MD.0000000000013784;2018-12-30;"[{'lastname': 'Whang', 'firstname': 'Woong-Joo', 'initials': 'WJ', 'affiliation': ""Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Yeouido St. Mary's Hospital.""}, {'lastname': 'Yoo', 'firstname': 'Young-Sik', 'initials': 'YS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Convergence Medical Science.'}, {'lastname': 'Joo', 'firstname': 'Choun-Ki', 'initials': 'CK', 'affiliation': ""Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea.""}, {'lastname': 'Yoon', 'firstname': 'Geunyoung', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Flaum Eye Institute, Center for Visual Science, The Institute of Optics, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, USA.'}]"

Retropupillary iris claw IOL was fixated in 48 eyes (46%) and SFIOL was performed in 56 eyes. Iris claw was performed more frequently at the time of primary cataract surgery (56%) compared to SFIOL (14%) (P < 0.001). At 1 month postoperative, BCDVA was significantly better in the SFIOL group [0.7 ± 0.5 logarithm of minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) in iris claw vs. 0.3 ± 0.2 logMAR in SFIOL, P < 0.001] but this difference did not persist at 1 year (0.4 ± 0.4 logMAR in iris claw vs. 0.3 ± 0.2 logMAR in SFIOL, P = 0.56). Eyes with iris claw IOL experienced significantly more postoperative iritis (17%), intraocular pressure spikes (10%), and ovalization of the pupil (16%).
Retropupillary iris claw IOL fixation is as safe as SFIOL for visual rehabilitation of post-cataract aphakia. Visual rehabilitation following iris claw IOL might take longer than SFIOL.

Pronounced opacity is a complication that must be taken seriously because it can lead to explantation or exchange of the intraocular lens (IOL). The calcification of hydrophilic IOLs is often made responsible for an explantation. Despite the rapidly increasing number of intravitreal injections, they have so far not been associated with opacification of lenses. This article reports on a female patient where opacification of the hydrophilic lens was obviously associated with multiple intravitreal injections over several years. It involved a secondary calcification with calcium phosphate deposition directly under the surface of the IOL. Possible pathomechanisms are discussed. Due to the increasing number of intravitreal injections the association with IOL opacity should be further evaluated in the future.

249;30502859;Cataracts in Labrador Retriever and Jack Russell Terrier From the United Kingdom: A Two-Year Retrospective Study.;['Jack Russell Terrier', 'Labrador Retriever', 'canine', 'cataract', 'phacoemulsification'];Topics in companion animal medicine;"Cataracts are among the most common ocular diseases, and are a leading cause of vision loss in humans and dogs. Jack Russell Terriers (JRT) and Labrador Retrievers (LR) are among the most popular canine breeds in the United Kingdom, and also among the most affected by cataracts. This study aimed to analyze the clinical features and the surgical outcome of cataracts in JRT and LR in an ophthalmologic reference Veterinary Hospital in the United Kingdom. For that purpose, medical records from JRT and LR diagnosed with cataracts between January 2015 and December 2016 were retrospectively evaluated. Data related to identification, clinical history, preoperative features, and surgical outcomes were analyzed. Forty-four dogs (81 eyes), including 26 JRT and 18 LR, were enrolled in the study. Mean ages were 10.2 ± 3.2 years in JRT and 8.5 ± 3.7 years in LR. Twenty-eight (63.6%) were females and 16 (36.4%) were males. Most dogs (84.1%) presented with bilateral cataracts. Nuclear and cortical cataracts were the most prevalent type in both breeds (JRT: n = 30, 61.2%; LR: n = 16, 50.0%), although subcapsular cataracts were also frequent in LR (n = 10, 31.3%). Significant differences in cataract location within the lens were detected between the two breeds (P = .002). Senile in JRT (n = 7) and genetic in LR (n = 7) were the most common etiologies. Concomitant ocular lesions were more frequent in dogs presented with cataracts in advanced stages, and included lens (n = 18; JRT: n = 15; LR: n = 3) and retinal alterations (n = 8; JRT: n = 2; LR: n = 6), and glaucoma (n = 6; JRT: n = 5; LR: n = 1). Thirty-three animals (75.0%, 51 eyes) were submitted to phacoemulsification with intraocular lens placement. Of these, 28 eyes (54.9%; JRT: n = 21; LR: n = 7) were visual, 19 eyes (37.3%; JRT: n = 11; LR: n = 8) presented impaired vision and four eyes (7.8%; JRT: n = 0; LR: n = 4) were blind at last clinical record. Postoperative complications were detected in 11 eyes (21.6%), and were more frequent in dogs presented with cataracts in advanced stages. These results and the multifactorial nature of cataracts call for further studies to identify and characterize the variables in a broader assessment, including other breeds and influencing factors.";;;;Copyright © 2018.

251;30489358;Preoperative evaluation for cataract surgery.;[];Current opinion in ophthalmology;"To provide a consolidated update regarding preoperative evaluation for cataract surgery.
Visual acuity alone is a poor gauge of cataract disability. Modalities such as wave front aberrometry, lens densitometry, and light-scatter assessments can quantify optical aspects of cataract and may prove clinically useful in surgical evaluation. Advances in biometry are driving improvements in refractive outcomes, which in turn have increased patient expectations. Future advances in biometry technology may include three-dimensional imaging of the cornea and lens. Screening for ocular comorbidities has become increasingly important, particularly to guide lens selection. Risk stratification systems can help guide surgical decisions and may decrease intraoperative complication rate. A comprehensive medical history and physical is currently mandated for all Medicare patients undergoing cataract surgery but may be of limited utility for low-risk patients.
Rising patient expectations and a growing number of surgical choices have expanded the cataract preoperative evaluation. A systematic and comprehensive examination which includes identifying any ocular comorbidity is essential for surgical planning and counseling on visual prognosis. New technologies will continue to inform, but not replace, sound clinical judgment.";;;;;10.1097/ICU.0000000000000535;2018-11-30;[{'lastname': 'See', 'firstname': 'Craig W', 'initials': 'CW', 'affiliation': 'Cole Eye Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.'}, {'lastname': 'Iftikhar', 'firstname': 'Mustafa', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Wilmer Eye Institute, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Woreta', 'firstname': 'Fasika A', 'initials': 'FA', 'affiliation': 'Wilmer Eye Institute, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.'}]

Five monofocal IOL models (Clareon CNA0T0, Tecnis ZCB00, enVista MX60, Eternity W-60, and Vivinex XY1) were used to evaluate glare or positive dysphotopsia-type phenomena. Optical simulations of incoming light were generated using nonsequential ray-tracing software based on a collimated light source for various off-axis angles of illumination. The simulation analyses were verified using a laboratory in vitro bench-top glare measurement system.
The Clareon and Vivinex IOLs produced focused off-axis images with negligible peripheral glare characteristics. The Tecnis and enVista IOLs produced dispersed images with additional glare characteristics at 45 degrees of off-axis illumination and higher. The Eternity IOL showed the highest edge-reflected glare characteristic, likely because of its straight optic edge geometry. The laboratory bench images and glare intensity profiles were consistent with the simulation data.
In vitro and nonsequential ray-tracing evaluations showed that straight optic edges and peripheral nonimaging optic geometry might contribute to positive dysphotopsia.

Resource-use data were collected over a 6-month postoperative period. Consecutive patients with bilateral age-related cataract and 1.25 diopters or more of corneal astigmatism were included in the economic evaluation. Patients were randomized to phacoemulsification with bilateral toric or monofocal IOL implantation. All relevant resources were included in the cost analysis. The base-case analysis was performed from a societal perspective based on quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The main outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.
The analysis comprised 77 consecutive patients (33 toric IOL; 44 monofocal IOL). Societal costs were higher in the toric IOL group (€3203 [$3864]) than in the monofocal IOL group (€2796 [US$3373]). QALYs were slightly lower in the toric IOL group (0.30 versus 0.31; P = .75). Toric IOLs were therefore inferior to monofocal IOLs from a cost-effectiveness perspective. The cost-effectiveness probability ranged from 1% to 15%, assuming a ceiling ratio for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €2500 to €20 000 per QALY.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate patient-reported satisfaction and spectacle dependence for key activities of daily living after cataract surgery with pseudophakic mini-monovision. The study also examined statistical relationships between patient demographic variables, visual acuity and satisfaction.
Prospective cohort study of 56 patients (112 eyes) who underwent bilateral cataract surgery with pseudophakic mini-monovision. Mini-monovision corrects one eye for distance vision and the other eye is focused at near with - 0.75 to - 1.75 D of myopia. All patients with 1 diopter or greater of corneal astigmatism had a monofocal toric IOLs implanted or limbal relaxing incision. The main study outcomes were assessed at the last follow-up appointment and included refraction, visual acuity, patient reported spectacle use, and patient satisfaction. Descriptive statistics, correlation matrixes and Pearson's chi-square tests were examined.
Uncorrected visual acuity was significantly better post-operatively. Most patients reported the surgery met their expectations for decreased dependence on spectacles (93%). Most patients report little or no use of spectacles post-operatively for computer use (93%), distance viewing (93%) and general use throughout the day (87%). A small number of patients report spectacle use for reading (9%) and night driving (18%). There were no relationships detected between demographic variables and visual acuity or patient satisfaction.
Aging of the population presents one of the biggest challenges in the health sector, which includes a rising number of individuals with chronic vision impairment and increased demand for accessible treatment strategies. Cataract surgery with pseudophakic mini-monovision results in high patient satisfaction and considerable reduction in spectacle dependence. Pseudophakic mini-monovision technique is a low-cost, valuable option for patients who would like to reduce dependence on spectacles post-operatively and should be considered along with premium multifocal IOLs in options available for patients based on their needs, preferences and clinical indicators. Reducing spectacle dependence with the pseudophakic mini-monovision technique could improve the functionality, independence and quality of life for many patients who are unsuitable or are unable to pay additional fees associated with premium multifocal IOLs.";;;Uncorrected visual acuity was significantly better post-operatively.

Child & adolescent health;"International initiatives to prevent childhood blindness have highlighted the importance of early, effective intervention for congenital and infantile cataract. In the UK, intraocular lens implantation has been widely adopted by surgeons to treat these conditions. However, evidence about the benefits and risks of this technique in different age groups is limited. The IoLunder2 study assessed outcomes following primary intraocular lens implantation in children aged 2 years and younger with congenital or infantile cataract.
The IoLunder2 study was a prospective observational cohort study done at 31 sites in the UK and Ireland. Eligible children were aged 2 years or younger who had cataract surgery concurrently with intraocular lens implantation or conventional treatment (aphakic correction with contact lenses or glasses) after cataract surgery between Jan 1, 2009, and Dec 31, 2010. Children with significant ocular comorbidity precluding lens implantation, defined by the presence of complex persistent fetal vasculature, other ocular structural anomalies, severe microcornea (horizontal corneal diameter <9·5 mm), or severe microphthalmos (axial length <16 mm), were excluded from the analysis of the key outcomes. Postoperative visual rehabilitation was assessed at 1, 3, and 5 years after surgery with a 4m logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) notation test. Best corrected visual outcome (acuity) overall was assessed 5 years after surgery for children with bilateral and unilateral cataract. We also used multivariable logistic and linear regression to model the association between intraocular lens implantation and outcomes of interest (vision, glaucoma, and visual axis opacity).
A total of 256 eligible children were recruited; two had incomplete data and were excluded. 158 of the 254 included children (102 [65%] with bilateral cataract and 56 [35%] with unilateral cataract) had no significant ocular morbidity and were analysed for the key outcomes. Primary intraocular lens implantation was done in 88 (56%) of 158 children (50 children with bilateral cataract and 38 children with unilateral cataract). 70 (44%) of 158 children had conventional treatment (52 with bilateral cataract and 18 with unilateral cataract). Overall median visual acuity at 5 years was 0·34 logMAR (IQR 0·20-0·54) for children with bilateral cataract and 0·70 logMAR (IQR 0·3-1·3) in the operated eye for children with unilateral cataract. Primary intraocular lens implantation was not associated with better visual outcome than conventional treatment in children with bilateral cataract (adjusted coefficient -0·1, 95% CI -0·5 to 0·3, p=0·48) or unilateral cataract (adjusted coefficient -0·3, -0·6 to 0·2, p=0·36), or reduced incidence of postoperative glaucoma in children with bilateral cataract (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0·5, 0·10 to 1·80, p=0·28), but was associated with a five times higher risk of reoperation for visual axis opacity requiring general anaesthesia in children with bilateral cataract (adjusted OR 5·94, 95% CI 2·14-16·47, p=0·001) and a 20 times higher risk in children with unilateral cataract (20·15, 3·01-134·00, p=0·001).
The findings of this cohort study indicate that intraocular lens implantation does not confer better vision or protection against postoperative glaucoma, and conversely increases the risk of requiring early reoperation in children younger than 2 years with bilateral or unilateral cataract. The routine use of intraocular lens implantation in this age group cannot be recommended.

Prospective, comparative, interventional study.
Nine hundred thirty eyes with cataract and uncomplicated pseudoexfoliation (without phacodonesis, clinically shallow anterior chambers, or pupil size <4 mm) and 476 controls with cataract but without pseudoexfoliation recruited from 4 centers of the Aravind Eye Care System in Southern India. The 2 groups were randomized separately to receive either a single-piece acrylic intraocular lens (IOL; SA60AT; Alcon Laboratories, Fort Worth, TX) or a 3-piece acrylic IOL (MA60AS; Alcon Laboratories). The pseudoexfoliation group also was randomized to receive or not receive a capsular tension ring.
All eyes underwent phacoemulsification with IOL implantation and were followed up at 1 day, 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year after surgery.
Association of pseudoexfoliation status with intraoperative complication rates, 1-year best-corrected visual acuity, and any other complications.

Retrospective case series.
Patients had primary cataract extraction with IOL implantation with globe repair (Group A) or repair followed by secondary IOL implantation (Group B). Preoperative and surgery data, visual outcomes, and postoperative complications were recorded.
The study included 139 patients. Thirty (49%) of 61 patients in Group A and 47 (60%) of 78 patients in Group B achieved a corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) of 20/40 or better. In both groups, a central corneal scar and amblyopia were the main reasons for not achieving a CDVA better than 20/40. The mean spherical equivalent (SE) was 1.81 diopters (D) in Group A and 1.55 D in Group B. Forty patients (66%) in Group A and in 60 patients (77%) in Group B achieved a desirable refractive outcome (SE <2.00 D). A large wound was the greatest risk factor for not obtaining desirable refractive outcomes. Fibrinous uveitis was the most common postoperative complication in both groups. Pupillary optic capture and IOL decentration were significantly more common in Group A than in Group B (P = .02), while strabismus was significantly more common in Group B (P = .04).
Both approaches had satisfactory and comparable visual and refractive outcomes. However, primary IOL implantation can be considered in cases with small peripheral corneal lacerations with the goal of providing early visual rehabilitation and avoiding repeat general anesthesia.";;;The study included 139 patients.

This study included 113 eyes of 64 patients who underwent lensectomy and vitrectomy. In all, 36 eyes remained aphakic after surgery. Intraocular lens implantation was performed at the time of surgery in 47 eyes and secondarily in 30 eyes. Corneal hysteresis, corneal resistance factor, and cornea-compensated intraocular pressure were measured. The influences of independent factors on the difference between the cornea-compensated intraocular pressure and intraocular pressure measured with Goldmann applanation tonometer were investigated using linear regression analyses. Agreement between the two tonometers was investigated using the Bland and Altman and 95% limits of agreement analysis.

Aravind Eye Hospital and Postgraduate Institute of Ophthalmology, Pondicherry, India.
Prospective observational study.
Patients with posterior polar cataract who had phacoemulsification between October 2012 and November 2013 were included in the study. Preoperative AS-OCT imaging was performed to assess the integrity of the posterior capsule. Anterior segment OCT images of the posterior capsule were graded as ""intact"" or ""dehiscent."" Phacoemulsification was performed by the same surgeon who was masked from the AS-OCT findings. The integrity of the posterior capsule was evaluated by the surgeon intraoperatively.
The study comprised 64 eyes of 62 patients. Preoperative AS-OCT showed 8 eyes (12.5%) to have probable posterior capsule dehiscence and 56 eyes (87.5%) to have intact posterior capsules. Intraoperatively, the surgeon noted posterior capsule dehiscence in 5 eyes (7.8%) and an intact posterior capsule in 59 eyes (92.2%). The sensitivity and specificity of AS-OCT for detecting posterior capsule dehiscence was 100% and 94.92%, respectively. The negative predictive value of AS-OCT was 100%.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty-nine patients (50 eyes) aged 78.94±5.54 years, previously treated with intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents, were qualified for a prospective, randomized 12-month study. The participants were divided into 2 groups. Group I consisted of 25 patients (25 eyes) who were subjected to phacoemulsification cataract surgery. Group II consisted of 24 patients (25 eyes) who were not subjected to phacoemulsification cataract surgery despite having a lens opacity of grade II or higher according to the Lens Opacities Classification System. RESULTS After 12 months of follow-up, patients in group I gained on average 8.04 letters (p<0.001). Furthermore, 20% of the eyes had a significant improvement in best corrected visual acuity of ≥15 Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study Chart letters. Patients in group II lost on average 1.96 letters (p>0.05). No significant differences between central retinal thickness values in either group (p>0.05) were noted. The mean number of intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents during the study was 2.64±1.98 in group I and 2.92±2.40 in group II (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS Phacoemulsification performed in eyes with wet age-related macular degeneration during the inactive phase of the disease significantly improves visual acuity.

Prospective study.
In this prospective study, patients scheduled for cataract surgery received a plate-haptic IOL (Asphina, Carl Zeiss Meditec AG) or an open-loop haptic IOL (ZCB00, Johnson & Johnson). Preoperatively, optical biometry (IOLMaster 700, CZM, or Lenstar, Haag-Streit) was performed. Intraoperatively, a prototype setup was used to perform time-domain OCT scans of the anterior eye segment (Visante connected to OPMI Lumera 200, both CZM). The intraoperative ACD was measured and used to predict the postoperative IOL position. Optical biometry and subjective refraction and autorefraction (RM 8800, Topcon) were performed 2 months postoperatively.
The study comprised 203 eyes of 203 patients. A partial least-square regression model for ACD generated 2 months postoperatively showed that the predictive power of the intraoperative ACD (0.48) was highest followed by the axial eye length (0.45) and then the preoperatively measured ACD (0.30). These findings were confirmed in a bootstrapping model. Regression models combining the preoperative ACD and intraoperative ACD resulted in further significant improvement.

Little is known of the daytime blue light influence on alertness in elders. A prospective with-in subject study was carried out in Peking University Third Hospital to evaluate the impact of cataract surgery on visual functions and the electroencephalogram alertness response to blue light stimulus before and after surgery. 14 participants diagnosed with age-related cataract were scheduled for monocular cataract surgery with ultraviolet-filtering intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), color discrimination and electroencephalogram results were measured before and after surgery. Exposure to blue light resulted in decreased delta (0.25-3.00 Hz) activity and increased beta (13.25-30.00 Hz) activity both before and after cataract surgery. Significant improvements in the BCVA and Farnsworth-Munsell-100-hue total error scores were found after cataract surgery. The partial error scores in the red-yellow, green blue-blue, and blue purple-purple red bands also showed significant differences, with the green blue-blue band showing the most obvious improvement. Day-time blue light stimulus can increase alertness in elderly people with significant cataracts. Cataract surgery with ultraviolet-filtering IOL implantation can increase light, particularly blue light transmittance. Opaque lens removal does not increase the alertness responses to blue light 1 day after surgery.

The lenses under evaluation were trifocal intraocular lenses made of hydrophilic acrylic material: a spherical lens 26% hydrophilic acrylic (POD FineVision), a similar lens but having a toric design (POD Toric FineVision), and a trifocal lens 25% hydrophilic acrylic material (FineVision/MicroF). Moreover, the lenses share the same optical zone design. The lenses' rotational stability and centration were measured by means of the PIOLET software, which relies on recording and image processing techniques to determine lens rotation and centration based on slit-lamp images. We also assessed patients' visual quality by means of 25, 40, and 80 cm VA tests.
The best centration results were achieved with the POD Toric FineVision model, although the differences were not statistically significant. As for lens rotation, it was below 5° in all cases under study. Regarding VA, all subjects attained at least 0.3 logMAR for far distance uncorrected VA, at 80 cm VA was about 0.2 logMAR, at 40 cm it was above 0.15 logMAR, and at 25 cm it was about 0.3 logMAR for both lens types.

One hundred and forty-eight male (214 eyes) and 138 female (194 eyes) VKH patients with complicated cataract were included. Surgery was performed on 352 eyes after complete control of intraocular inflammation for at least 3 months. In another set of 56 eyes, surgery was done 1 month after intraocular inflammation control. There was no difference in postoperative complications or BCVA between these 2 groups. The main complications after surgery were hyphema, ocular hypertension, and moderate anterior chamber reaction. Average preoperative visual acuity was 0.08. At last visit, BCVA was improved in 405 eyes (99.3%). The preoperative BCVA, treatment delay after disease onset, preoperative intraocular hypertension, and iris synechiae were associated with final visual outcome. Other parameters such as postoperative inflammation, IOL type, and presence of extraocular VKH features did not affect final BCVA.

Standard side-port incisions are made, followed by anterior capsular staining. The fluid cortex in anterior intralenticular compartment is aspirated by puncturing anterior capsule in the center using a 30-gauge needle entered through a separate limbal stab incision. The nucleus edge is gently tipped posteriorly with the needle tip to release the fluid from posterior intralenticular compartment also and as much fluid aspirated as possible.

MSMT was based on sewing machine principle using a prethreaded 26G/30G needle with prolene suture for minimally invasive iris dialysis repair in a closed chamber manner. So far, eight patients (trauma - 3, surgical complication - 5) underwent this procedure. This technique is further modified to extend its use for IOL relocation - 2, iris coloboma repair - 3, and Cionni ring fixation for zonular dialysis - 2, SFIOL - 5 patients. All 20 patients had good visual recovery and cosmetic outcome with minimal morbidity. To conclude, MSMT offers cost -effective, minimally invasive, easy to learn procedure with a potential to tackle several problems related with cataract surgery and iris defects, which even an average cataract surgeon can learn to perform when required.

326;30030245;Trans-scleral explantation of posteriorly dislocated IOL-CTR complex in a case of anterior megalophthalmos with an unusually thin cornea.;['anterior chamber', 'ophthalmology', 'retina'];BMJ case reports;Anterior megalophthalmos and keratoglobus are characterised by corneal thinning and deep anterior chamber. They are clinically distinguished on the basis of normal to slightly decreased corneal thickness with a large corneal diameter (>13 mm) in case of anterior megalophthalmos, and marked limbus-to-limbus corneal thinning with globular protrusion in keratoglobus. To achieve and maintain a centred and stable intraocular lens (IOL) position in the bag is often difficult in cases of anterior megalophthalmos due to a too large diameter of the capsular bag and ciliary ring. We report a case of a 40-year-old man with features of anterior megalophthalmos with extremely thin cornea. He had spontaneous posterior dislocation of IOL and capsular tension ring (CTR) within the bag after initial successful cataract surgery. The dislocated complex could neither have been repositioned with scleral fixation due to large diameter of ciliary ring nor could it have been explanted through a clear corneal incision due to associated very thin cornea. We performed pars plana vitrectomy and separated the IOL-CTR complex inside the eye and explanted them separately through the sclerotomy, as is done for removal of intraocular foreign body. This avoided incision on the thin cornea. We conclude that this method can be very useful in a similar clinical situation but is complex enough to justify its use in routine cases.;;;;© BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2018.

Серозная отслойка сетчатки является редким послеоперационным осложнением факоэмульсификации с внутрикамерным введением антибиотиков. Лечебно-диагностическая тактика в подобных случаях требует уточнения. Цель - представить случай развития серозной отслойки сетчатки после факоэмульсификации с внутрикамерным введением цефуроксима. Материал и методы. Ретроспективный анализ данных пациента, которому выполнялась факоэмульсификация катаракты на обоих глазах, период наблюдения составил 5 мес. Результаты. Факоэмульсификация неосложненной катаракты с имплантацией интраокулярной линзы на правом глазу прошла без особенностей, в конце операции в переднюю камеру вводили цефуроксим в дозе 1 мг. В 1-е сутки после операции зрение снизилось до 0,2. По данным оптической когерентной томографии (ОКТ) в макулярной зоне выявлена серозная отслойка пигментного и нейроэпителия. По данным флюоресцентной ангиографии патологической сосудистой активности не отмечалось. Проводилась стандартная послеоперационная терапия, дополненная субтеноновым введением триамцинолона, внутривенными инъекциями дексаметазона и приемом ацетазоламида внутрь. Прилегание сетчатки ежедневно отслеживалось с помощью ОКТ. К 6-м суткам после операции острота зрения восстановилась до 1,0. Через 5 мес выявлена деформация внутреннего ретинального контура. В качестве 'контроля' был парный (левый) глаз пациента: спустя 5 мес после первой операции была выполнена факоэмульсификация катаракты без введения цефуроксима, послеоперационный период протекал без осложнений.

Thus, determination of the intralenticular pressure value is of great importance for safe intumescent cataract phacoemulsification.
To develop a technology for intralenticular pressure measurement in patients with intumescent cataract and to construct a mathematical model for its prognosis according to preoperative examination data.
Intralenticular pressure was measured in 11 eyes with intumescent cataract. Before that, the following parameters of the anterior compartment of the eye were examined: anterior chamber depth, lens thickness according to ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM), hypoechogenic layer (the anterior layer of liquefied lenticular masses), equatorial angle.
The intraoperative technology of the intralenticular pressure measurement was developed. The direct dependency between thickness of the swelling lens, hypoechogenic layer value (the anterior layer of liquefied lenticular masses), anterior chamber depth and intralenticular pressure magnitude was defined.
For the first time, the intraoperative intralenticular pressure was measured in patients with intumescent cataract. A dependency was defined between the thickness of the lens and the anterior layer of liquefied lenticular masses, anterior chamber depth, and intralenticular pressure magnitude; based on this, a mathematical model for intralenticular pressure measurement was constructed.

Prospective, multicenter, single-masked, randomized controlled trial.
Subjects with concomitant primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), visually significant cataract, and washed-out modified diurnal IOP (MDIOP) between 22 and 34 mmHg.
Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive a single Hydrus Microstent (Ivantis, Inc, Irvine, CA) in the Schlemm canal or no stent after uncomplicated phacoemulsification. Comprehensive eye examinations were conducted 1 day, 1 week, and 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months postoperatively. Medication washout and MDIOP measurement were repeated at 12 and 24 months.
The primary and secondary effectiveness end points were the proportion of subjects demonstrating a 20% or greater reduction in unmedicated MDIOP and change in mean MDIOP from baseline at 24 months, respectively. Hypotensive medication use was tracked throughout the course of follow-up. Safety measures included the frequency of surgical complications and adverse events.

The AcrySof cohort included 13,329 eyes, non-AcrySof hydrophobic 19,025 and non-AcrySof hydrophilic 19,808. The 3-year Nd:YAG capsulotomy incidence (95% CI) for AcrySof (2.4%, 2.2-2.7%) was approximately two times lower than non-AcrySof hydrophobic IOLs (4.4%, 4.1-4.7%) and approximately fourfold lower than non-AcrySof hydrophilic IOLs (10.9%, 10.5-11.3%). Trends were similar in PCO incidence (AcrySof: 4.7%; non-AcrySof hydrophobic: 6.3%; non-AcrySof hydrophilic: 14.8%). Also in the analysis restricted to single-piece IOLs, the pattern remained (2.4% vs 5.1% vs. 10.9%, respectively). Adjusted regression analysis showed a approximately two and fivefold increased odds of Nd:YAG for non-AcrySof hydrophobic and hydrophilic acrylic IOLs respectively vs. AcrySof IOLs. Nd:YAG capsulotomy ORs were similar and remained statistically significant in the single-piece IOL sub-group.

Retrospective cohort study.
We examined all patients who underwent cataract surgery and were receiving intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2016. There were 81 eyes that underwent cataract surgery and had received at least 1 intravitreal anti-VEGF injection for a diagnosis of exudative AMD within 6 months prior to surgery. Data collected included the development of subretinal or intraretinal macular fluid, or subretinal hemorrhage, in the 6 months following surgery; number of injections; best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA); and central subfield thickness (CST).
There was a significant improvement between preopertive and postoperative BCVA when comparing all patients (P values < .0001) and no significant difference in CST before and after surgery (P > .05). There were 23 eyes with fluid on the preoperative OCT. There were no differences in final BCVA or CST and no difference in the development of fluid postoperatively when compared to patients without fluid preoperatively (all P values > .05).

Systematic review and network meta-analysis.
The authors searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for relevant articles up to April 2017 with no language restrictions, and related studies meeting the eligibility criteria were included. A Bayesian framework was applied to compare the visual outcomes and complications of these 3 approaches.
A total of 14 studies with 845 eyes were included in the present report. There was no significant difference between any pair of surgical approaches in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and in final BCVA achieving 20/40 or better (Snellen). ISF presented a lower risk of cystoid macular edema (CME) compared with TSF (risk ratio [RR], 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], [0.18, 1.0]). IF showed superiorities in less intraocular hemorrhage (IOH) than ISF (RR, 0.078; 95% CI [0.0095, 0.38]), as well as TSF (RR, 0.26; 95% CI, [0.09, 0.72]). IF had a lower risk of glaucoma escalation; the difference was slightly higher than the conventional level of significance (RR, 0.41; 95% CI, [0.16, 1.04]). Moreover, the surgical time in IF was shorter than TSF (standard mean difference [SMD], -2.98; 95% CI, [-4.32, -1.64]) and ISF (SMD, -2.60; 95% CI, [-3.71, -1.49]). However, IF was associated with a significantly higher risk of endothelial cell density (ECD) impairment (SMD, -0.54; 95% CI, [-1.02, -0.05]) and significantly greater postoperative corneal endothelial cell loss rate (ECLR, %) (SMD, 0.35; 95% CI, [0.08, 0.63]) compared with TSF.
Postoperative visual outcomes were comparable among TSF, ISF, and IF for eyes with insufficient capsular support. However, the risk of some complications differed among approaches. IF showed its superiorities in lower risk of IOH and glaucoma escalation as well as shorter surgical time, while IF was at a disadvantage in greater endothelial cell impairment. Since some patients might have a clear contraindication to one of the surgical approaches, the decision of surgical approach eventually depends on surgeon experience and the presenting pathology.";;;"A total of 14 studies with 845 eyes were included in the present report.

Experimental study.
An experimental optoelectronic test bench was created. It consisted of a high-resolution monitor to project target images and an artificial eye. The system simulates the optical and geometric characteristics of the human eye with an implanted toric IOL. A 3.00 diopters corneal astigmatism was simulated. Images reproduced by the optical system were captured according to different IOL axis positions. The quality of each image was analyzed using the visual information fidelity (VIF) criterion. The VIF reduction was calculated at each IOL rotational step.
A 5-degree IOL axis rotation from the intended position determined a decay in the image quality of 7.03%. Ten degrees of IOL rotation caused an 11.09% decay of relative VIF value. For a 30-degree rotation, the VIF decay value was 45.85%. Finally, the image decay with no toric correction was 56.70%.
The more the objective quality of the image decays progressively, the further the axis of the IOL is rotated from its intended position.

Dr. Agarwal's Eye Hospital and Eye Research Centre, Chennai, India.
Prospective case series.
The IOL movement was recorded via slitlamp videography (DC3), streamed in video editor (Pinnacle), and evaluated by ImageJ analysis. The positional difference of Purkinje IV in relation to the stationary image Purkinje I at 3 random timeframes was measured. Pseudophakodonesis was quantified, compared, and correlated clinically.
The study comprised 127 eyes that had posterior chamber IOLs (PC IOLs) (n = 50), anterior chamber IOLs (AC IOLs) (n = 20), iris-claw IOLs (n = 20), glued IOLs (n = 30), and sutured scleral-fixated IOLs (n = 7). The iris-claw IOL showed significant difference in Purkinje IV at various timeframes (P = .0418) whereas others showed no significant change. On comparison of the Purkinje IV difference, there was a significant difference between the PC IOL and the iris-claw IOL (P = .0001), the glued IOL and the iris-claw IOL (P = .0020), and the AC IOL and the iris-claw IOL (P = .0302). The iris-claw IOL showed significant exaggeration of the position of Purkinje IV (P = .0395) after saccade. Pseudophakodonesis seemed mild (difference < 0.5 mm) in the PC IOL (68%), glued IOL (53.3%), and AC IOL (50%); moderate in the scleral-fixated IOL (71.4%); and severe (≥ 1.0 mm) in the iris-claw IOL (55%).

The primary study outcome measures were uncorrected and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and complications. Backscatters of corneal scar lesions were evaluated by slit lamp-based haze grading, Scheimpflug Pentacam and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT). Visual outcomes after cataract surgeries and improvement range were used to determine the safety and efficacy of cataract surgery for our patients.
All patients underwent uneventful capsulorhexis and phacoemulsification. The mean age was 72.22 ± 10.1 years, and the mean follow-up period was 18.57 ± 15.42 months. The mean BCVA significantly improved from 1.45 ± 0.65 preoperatively to 0.94 ± 0.55 logMAR postoperatively (p < 0.001), and the number of eyes with a BCVA of 20/100 or better increased from 4 to 14. Complications included corneal edema in two eyes and reactivation of the previous corneal pathology in five eyes. Four eyes did not achieve an improvement in visual acuity after surgery, which may have been due to co-existing ocular co-morbidities.

370;29668525;PRIMARY CORE VITRECTOMY TECHNIQUE BEFORE CATARACT SURGERY IN COMBINED PHACOVITRECTOMY FOR EYES WITH DENSE VITREOUS HEMORRHAGES.;[];Retina (Philadelphia, Pa.);"To investigate the efficacy and safety of a primary core vitrectomy technique for combined phacovitrectomy in eyes showing a poor red reflex because of dense vitreous hemorrhage before cataract surgery.
A total of 156 eyes from 156 patients, who underwent combined phacovitrectomy because of cataract and dense vitreous hemorrhage, and who were followed up for at least 6 months were included. The patients were divided into a primary phacoemulsification group (Group A, 80 eyes) who underwent phacoemulsification first followed by total vitrectomy and a primary vitrectomy group (Group B, 76 eyes) who underwent core vitrectomy first followed by cataract surgery and followed by total vitrectomy. A conventional 23-gauge combined phacovitrectomy was performed in all patients. The operation time, including the total continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis time and total cataract surgery time, and the incidence of surgery-related complications were evaluated in the two groups.
Diabetic retinopathy was the most common cause for vitreous hemorrhage in both groups (Group A: 51 eyes; Group B: 39 eyes). The total continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis time (P = 0.001) and total cataract surgery time (P = 0.036) were significantly shorter in Group B than in Group A. Among the complications, radial tears occurred more frequently in Group A than Group B, but these differences were not statistically significant (P = 0.211). Pupil size reduction during cataract surgery was greater in Group B than in Group A (P = 0.034). There were no significant differences in posterior capsular ruptures or posterior capsular opacities between the two groups. Other postoperative complications were not observed in either group until 6 months after surgery.
Primary core vitrectomy combined with phacovitrectomy of patients who had dense vitreous hemorrhage helped to obtain a good red reflex and enabled surgeons to perform successful cataract surgery.

The mechanism of action is thought to be via increased trabecular outflow facility. However, studies on the relationship between phacoemulsification and outflow facility have been inconsistent. This study intended to examine the change in electronic Schiotz tonographic outflow facility (TOF) and IOP measurements following phacoemulsification.
Patients who were due to undergo a standard clear corneal incision phacoemulsification with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation, at St Thomas' Hospital, were invited to participate in this study. IOP was measured using Goldmann's applanation tonometer, and TOF was measured by electronic Schiotz tonography at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively.
Forty-one patients were recruited. Tonography data for 27 patients were reliable and available at all time points. Eleven cases had primary open angle glaucoma and cataract, while 16 patients had cataract only. Mean IOP reduced at every time point postoperatively significantly compared with baseline. TOF improved significantly after cataract extraction at all time points (baseline of 0.14±0.06 vs 0.18±0.09 at 3 months, P=0.02 and 0.20±0.09 at 6 months, P=0.003, 0.17±0.07 µL/min mmHg at 12 months, P=0.04).

Prospective case series.
Patients having cataract surgery were randomized into 3 treatment groups as follows: Group A had 110-degree femtosecond reverse side-cut CCIs, Group B had 70-degree femtosecond forward side-cut CCIs, Group C had manual CCIs. At the conclusion of surgery, the integrity of the CCI was measured by raising intraocular pressure (IOP) until the CCI began to leak. Postoperatively, the CCIs were assessed for wound leakage at 1 day, 2 weeks, and 1 month.
The study comprised 45 patients (45 eyes, 15 in each treatment group). The mean IOP at which CCIs leaked (in response to anterior chamber balanced salt solution irrigation) was statistically significantly higher in Group A (28.20 mm Hg ± 11.69 [SD]) than in Group B (15.07 ± 10.64 mm Hg; P = .005) and Group C (9.93 ± 9.90 mm Hg; P < .001). At 1 day postoperatively, the Seidel test with pressure showed no leakage in any of the Group A eyes; however, 53% of eyes in Group B and 87% in Group C showed wound leakage.

The medical records of patients who underwent cataract surgery and posterior chamber IOL implantation (in-the-bag) for congenital cataract before 17 years of age were reviewed retrospectively. Target refractions calculated by Sanders-Retzlaff-Kraff (SRK)/II, SRK/T and Hoffer-Q formulae were compared with the actual refraction. Patients were subgroup according to the age at IOL implantation (age group 0-24 months, 25-60 months, 61-120 months, 121-203 months), and we compared mean prediction error (PE) and mean absolute error (AE) for each formula. Corrected AE was obtained by linear regression analysis.
Totally 481 eyes were included in the final analysis. Both SRK/II and SRK/T yielded the lowest mean AE in the age group 0-24 months and SRK/II yielded the lowest mean AE in the age group 25-60 months. For every formula, the mean PE was positive during the first five years of age, which converged to zero according to age as IOL implantation increases.

Retrospective case series.
The incidence of refractive surprise was evaluated in patients with and without glaucoma after phacoemulsification cataract surgery. Refractive surprise was defined as the difference in spherical equivalent of the refractive target and postoperative refraction in diopters (D).
The study comprised 206 eyes in the glaucoma group and 1162 control eyes. The refractive surprise greater than ±0.5 D and ±1.0 D was 29.9% and 4.9% in the control group and 40.3% (P = .0061) and 11.2% (P = .0011) in the glaucoma group. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) (n = 154 eyes), chronic angle-closure glaucoma (n = 18 eyes), and pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (n = 23 eyes) had odds ratios of 1.90 (P = .1760), 14.54 (P = .0006), and 7.27 (P = .0138), respectively, of refractive surprise greater than ±1.0 D compared with patients without glaucoma. Refractive surprise was noted more often in POAG eyes with axial lengths longer than 25.0 mm (P = .0298).

With this maneuver, the pupillary expansion ring is placed in alignment with the center of the ectopic lens. Femtosecond laser anterior capsulotomy and lens fragmentation is then performed. Next, the temporary suture is released, a capsular hook(s) is placed to support the lens, and the lens is emulsified. A modified capsular tension ring is then inserted and sutured to the ciliary sulcus to center the capsular bag and the intraocular lens is implanted.

With time, these patients develop symptomatic cataract, which affects activities of daily living, and to improve visual acuity, intraocular lens (IOL) implantation can be considered. In post-myopic LASIK patients, to allow continuation of spectacle independence, the implantation of presbyopia-correcting IOLs is a suitable option. The purpose of this retrospective case series is to report the visual outcome and quality in post-myopic LASIK eyes after the implantation of AT LISA tri839MP IOL.
Twenty eyes of 13 patients with history of myopic LASIK within 20 years underwent phacoemulsification by one single surgeon. All eyes were implanted with AT LISA tri839PMP IOL, and their outcomes were evaluated at 6 months postoperation.
The mean postoperative uncorrected distance visual acuity (VA) is 0.28 ± 0.29, while the corrected distance VA is 0.06 ± 0.14. The mean postoperative uncorrected near VA is 0.02 ± 0.05, while the corrected near VA is 0.01 ± 0.02. The mean postoperative manifest refraction spherical equivalent (SE) is - 0.92 ± 0.76D.

The indications for mechanical dilatation are fulfilled in patients where a sufficient pharmacological preoperative pupil dilatation is not possible.
During routine cataract surgery specific foldable rings can be employed to dilate the pupil with the appropriate injector under viscoelastic substances. These rings are carefully placed at the pupillary margin until circular pupillary dilatation up to 6-7 mm is achieved. After intraocular lens implantation and before removing the viscoelastic substance the rings are slowly folded into the injector and then removed. The surgical technique is demonstrated in detail with the help of a video of the operation, which is available online.
Mechanical pupillary dilatation was possible in all patients studied (n = 14), which allowed uncomplicated phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation. For both ring systems studied the mean pupillary dilatation was 6.6 mm. At the end of surgery, the pupillary diameter was 4.89 mm using a Malyugin ring (MST, Redmond, Washington, USA) and 4.93 mm with an I‑ring (Visitec, Waltham, MA, USA; P > 0.05).

Intrascleral fixation was performed in six eyes and the results evaluated in this retrospective case series.

The area of the anterior capsule opening reduced by 3.53 ± 3.31 mm (17.06% ± 15.99%) between 1 week and 2 months post-operatively in the IOL A group, by 0.62 ± 1.32 mm (2.87% ± 6.03%) in the IOL B group, and by 1.09 ± 1.53 mm (4.72% ± 6.10%) in the IOL C group. The IOL B group showed minimal anterior capsule contraction 2 months after surgery (p < 0.001).
IOLs with a four-plate haptic design (IOL B) showed more anterior capsular stability than those with a two-loop plate haptic (IOL A) or two-plate haptic (IOL C) design. The number and position of haptics in a capsular bag may affect anterior capsule contraction. We assume that supporting the zonules evenly may play a role in anterior capsular stability.

Patients who underwent pediatric cataract surgery and intraocular lens implantation between 2008 and 2016 were evaluated in this retrospective study. Patients aged 3-15 years with unilateral or bilateral cataract and without corneal pathology were included in the study. The patients were categorized into the following two groups: those who underwent posterior capsulorhexis and anterior vitrectomy using in-the-bag intraocular lens implantation (group 1) and those who underwent posterior capsulorhexis and intraocular lens implantation with the optic fixed behind the posterior capsulorhexis (group 2). Rates of postoperative visual axis opacification and complications (glaucoma, posterior synechiae, uveitic reaction, and intraocular lens decentration) were evaluated in these groups. The implanted intraocular lenses were either monoblock (AcrySof SN60AT intraocular lens), triple-piece (AcrySof MA60BM intraocular lens) foldable hydrophobic acrylic lenses, or multifocal lenses (AcrySof IQ ReSTOR).

395;29527012;Accuracy of intraocular lens power calculation using three optical biometry measurement devices: the OA-2000, Lenstar-LS900 and IOLMaster-500.;[];Eye (London, England);"To compare ocular measurements of three optical biometry devices and their application in intraocular lens (IOL) power calculations.
One hundred and forty eyes which had undergone cataract extraction surgery with preoperative biometry with OA--2000, IOLMaster-500, and Lenstar-LS900 were enrolled. Biometry measurements of the three devices were compared. The deviation of the postoperative refraction from the preoperative refractive target was calculated with different formulas (Barrett Universal II, Hoffer Q, Holladay I, and SRK/T). Errors in the predicted astigmatism using the Barrett toric calculator were calculated for the toric IOLs. Additional 6465 eyes in which the IOLMaster-500 failed to measure axial length (AL) were reviewed. The percentage of successful measurements using the OA-2000 in those eyes was calculated.
High agreement was found between the three devices for AL, anterior chamber depth, and average keratometry measurements (interclass correlation confidents: 1.000, 0.970, and 0.998, respectively, P < 0.001). The mean absolute prediction errors were similar using all formulas, ranging from 0.25 to 0.29 D, with no statistical significant difference between the three devices per each formula. The OA-2000 yielded a lower against-the-rule (ATR) centroid error in the predicted astigmatism than the IOLMaster-500 and Lenstar-LS900 (0.06 D ± 0.59 at 13.4° vs. 0.20 D ± 0.61 at 14.8° and 0.16 D ± 0.55 at 21.4°, respectively, P < 0.001, X-axis).

One hundred six children (mean age 7.6 years ± 3.9 [SD]) were included. The median follow-up was 41 months (range 3 to 155 months). Seventy-nine children had open-globe injuries and 27 had closed-globe injuries. Patients with open-globe injuries were younger than those with closed-globe injuries (mean age 6.9 versus 10.4 years; P < .05). The final corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) was 20/40 or better in 47 children. In the 94 children who had intraocular lens placement, 54% with open-globe injuries and 55% with closed-globe injuries achieved a mean absolute prediction error of 1.0 diopter or less in the early postoperative period.

Our aim is to determine the in vitro feasibility of MTX-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic) (PLGA) biomatrices sprayed on intraocular lenses (IOLs) as a drug-delivery implant.
Hydrophilic and hydrophobic acrylic IOLs were spray-coated with MTX-loaded PLGA. Unsprayed, solvent only, and solvent-PLGA-sprayed IOLs served as controls. All IOLs were evaluated for their growth-inhibiting properties in an in vitro anterior segment model and the ex vivo human capsular bag. The release kinetics of MTX from the IOLs was determined. The toxicity of MTX on corneal endothelial cells was evaluated by using a dye reduction colorimetric assay. MTX was also used in a scratch assay.
MTX-PLGA-IOL showed a significant difference in cell proliferation and migration compared with all controls in the anterior segment model (p < 0.001) and in the human capsular bag model (p = 0.04). No difference in viability was observed on corneal endothelial cells (p = 0.43; p = 0.61). MTX significantly inhibited cells in the scratch assay (p = 0.02).

We used a new SS-OCT laboratory prototype designed to enhance the visualization of the crystalline lens and imaged the entire anterior segment of both eyes in two groups of participants: patients scheduled to undergo cataract surgery, n = 17, age range 36 to 91 years old, and volunteers without visual complains, n = 14, age range 20 to 81 years old. Pre-cataract surgery patients were also clinically graded according to the Lens Opacification Classification System III. The three-dimensional location and shape of the visible opacities were compared with the clinical grading.
Hypo- and hyperreflective features were visible in the lens of all pre-cataract surgery patients and in some of the older adults in the volunteer group. When the clinical examination revealed cortical or subcapsular cataracts, hyperreflective features were visible either in the cortex parallel to the surfaces of the lens or in the posterior pole. Other type of opacities that appeared as hyporeflective localized features were identified in the cortex of the lens. The OCT signal in the nucleus of the crystalline lens correlated with the nuclear cataract clinical grade.
A dedicated OCT is a useful tool to study in vivo the subtle opacities in the cataractous crystalline lens, revealing its position and size three-dimensionally.

We performed a prospective, descriptive, and monocentric study on patients undergoing cataract surgery with toric implantation (Asphina 709 Zeiss), operated by a surgeon with good experience in toricity, between September 2016 and March 2017. We analyzed the agreement between the manual marking of the 0°-180° axis versus the one automatically generated by the Callisto™, as well as the alignment of the IOL and the refractive results at 1 month.
We included 50 eyes of 26 patients. The corrected mean astigmatism was 1.9 D. The mean difference between the 2 axes was 4.7° [0°-12.3°]. Only 50 % of the preoperative manual markings were consistent with the automatic measurement (<5°). At one month, the average rotation recorded was 4.3° [0°-29°]. The alignment was identical for 70 % (n=35) of the IOL (≤5°). As for residual subjective astigmatism, it was on average 0.58 D. The mean visual acuity without correction was 8/10 and 55 % had 10/10 without correction.
The refractive performance depends on the preoperative measurement, the correct alignment of the IOL and its stability in the bag. Our study shows the value of automatic conjunctival recognition in the determination of the axis of peroperative alignment, even in an experienced operator. This precision is essential for a good refractive result, especially since the residual astigmatism in case of misalignment will increase with the power of the implant.

Retrospective chart review.
Patients who had cataract surgery performed in the first 3 months of femtosecond laser (FSL) technology use were compared with patients who had conventional phacoemulsification in the 3 months before FSL installation at Brandon Regional Health Centre (Brandon, Man.).
The primary outcome measure was the time needed to complete FLACS versus the time needed to complete conventional phacoemulsification. Secondary outcome measures were the time the patient spent in the operating room (time in and time out) and the number of cataract surgeries done per surgical day before and after FSL was implemented systemwide.

Retrospective study.
A total of 279 eyes of 230 children who underwent SSFIOL at ≤18 years of age in a tertiary eye care centre in India.
Treatment-naive children having traumatic cataract or subluxated lens underwent a single-sitting lensectomy and pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), along with SSFIOL insertion. Children with aphakia underwent PPV with SSFIOL, and vitrectomized eyes underwent only SSFIOL implantation. Fixation of SSFIOL was done by the 4-point ab externo fixation technique using 10-0 prolene suture.
Preoperative and postoperative visual acuity, as well as intraoperative and postoperative complications.
The mean age at which SSFIOL was performed was 10.8 ± 4.22 years. The most common indication of SSFIOL in our study was traumatic subluxation of lens (47.63%; n = 133 patients), followed by congenital subluxation in 38.7% (n = 108). Best-corrected visual acuity was maintained or improved from the preoperative visual acuity in 93.19% of eyes. The complications included choroidal detachment in 2.86% (n = 8), dispersed vitreous hemorrhage in 2.86% (n = 8), endophthalmitis in 0.72% (n = 2), raised intraocular pressure in 12.54% (n = 35), diplopia in 0.72% (n = 2), retinal detachment in 5.73% (n = 16), and dislocation of the SSFIOL in 4.6% (n = 13).

To evaluate contact lens adherence and its association with visual outcome in a cohort of children treated for unilateral cataract surgery.
Secondary analysis of a multicenter randomized clinical trial of 57 infants born from August 22, 2004, to April 25, 2008, who were randomized to 1 of 2 treatments and followed up to age 5 years. Data analysis was performed from August 9, 2016, to December 7, 2017.
Unilateral cataract extraction and randomization to implantation of an intraocular lens vs contact lens to correct aphakia.
Contact lens adherence was assessed by a 48-hour recall telephone interview that was administered every 3 months starting 3 months after surgery to age 5 years. A traveling examiner assessed visual acuity in patients at aged 4.5 years. Adherence to prescribed contact lens use was estimated as the mean percentage of waking hours as reported in 2 or more interviews for each year of life.
Of 57 infants who were randomized to contact lens treatment, 32 (56%) were girls, and 49 (86%) were white. A total of 872 telephone interviews were completed. In year 1, a median of 95% participants wore their contacts lenses nearly all waking hours (interquartile range [IQR], 84%-100%); year 2, 93% (IQR, 85%-99%); year 3, 93% (IQR, 85%-99%); year 4, 93% (IQR, 75%-99%); and year 5, 89% (IQR, 71%-97%). There was a tendency for poorer reported adherence at older ages (F = 3.86, P < .001). No differences were identified when the results were analyzed by sex, insurance coverage, or age at cataract surgery. Using linear regression, children who wore the contact lens for a greater proportion of waking hours during the entire study period tended to have better visual acuity at age 4.5 years, even after accounting for adherence to patching (partial correlation = -0.026; P = .08).
These results confirm that it is possible to achieve a high level of aphakic contact lens adherence over a 5-year period in children.

422;29369235;Global Practice Patterns in the Management of Infantile Cataracts.;[];Eye & contact lens;"Surveys are an important tool to assess the impact of research on physicians' approach to patient care. This survey was conducted to assess current practice patterns in the management of infantile cataracts in light of the findings of the Infant Aphakia Treatment Study.
Pediatric ophthalmologists were emailed a link to the survey using newsletters from American Association of Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus, World Society of Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus, and the Pediatric Listserv. The 17-question survey was anonymous and active during July to August 2016.
One hundred twenty-five respondents (North America, 65%; Asia, 12%; Europe, 9%; and other, 14%) reported operating on pediatric cataracts. Most practice in a university setting (55%). There was a strong consensus that unilateral cataract surgery should be performed between ages 4 to 6 weeks and aphakic contact lenses should be used to optically correct their eyes, particularly in children ≤6 months of age. For bilateral cataracts, there was a trend for surgeons to perform cataract surgery at an older age than unilateral cataract surgery. Surgeons who performed less than 5 versus greater than 20 pediatric cataract surgeries/year were more likely to use aphakic contact lenses in children undergoing cataract surgery more than 6 months of age (62% vs. 35%, P=0.04).

There was a strong consensus that unilateral cataract surgery should be performed between ages 4 to 6 weeks and aphakic contact lenses should be used to optically correct their eyes, particularly in children ≤6 months of age. For bilateral cataracts, there was a trend for surgeons to perform cataract surgery at an older age than unilateral cataract surgery.

A prospective cohort study.
Twenty-eight myopic eyes and 56 emmetropic eyes were evaluated. Phacoemulsification with Tecnis ZMB00 MfIOL (Abbott Medical Optics, Santa Ana, California, USA) implantation was performed. At 1 year post-surgery, routine postoperative examinations were performed, and tilt and decentration of the MfIOLs, high-order aberrations, and modulation transfer function (MTF) were evaluated using the OPD-Scan III aberrometer (Nidek Co, Ltd, Gamagori, Japan). Subjective symptoms were assessed with a Quality of Vision questionnaire.
Postoperative uncorrected distance visual acuity (VA), best-corrected distance VA, and uncorrected near VA did not differ between the 2 groups. The mean IOL tilt and horizontal decentration were not different between the control and myopic groups. However, the myopic group presented significantly inferior decentration in the capsular bag compared with the control group (-0.03 ± 0.22 mm vs -0.21 ± 0.29 mm, P = .002). The overall decentration values were 0.32 ± 0.14 mm in the controls and 0.40 ± 0.18 mm in the myopic group (P = .023).

The goal is to evaluate this implantation technique when traditional implantation is impossible.
This is an observational, retrospective, monocentric study at the Amiens university medical center between August 2013 and March 2016. Patients all underwent scleral fixation of a three-piece implant without suturing of the haptics, after posterior vitrectomy. All patients requiring implantation in the absence of stable capsular support were included. Patients with adequate iris or capsular support were excluded from our study.
Eighteen patients were included, with an average age of 69.3±16.9 years. The surgical indications were: complicated surgery, trauma and endothelial decompensation. The preoperative mean corrected visual acuity was 1.2±0.4 LogMAR while the postoperative acuity was 0.7±0.5 LogMAR. The mean postoperative corneal astigmatism was 1.9±1.9 diopters. The main complications observed were ocular hypertension, macular edema, retinal detachment, iris incarceration and exteriorization of the haptic.
There are two alternatives when faced with lack of a sufficient capsular support: scleral fixation or iris fixation. Our technique is the only one achievable in the presence of iris atrophy. Furthermore, it induces less astigmatism and enables the repositioning of a three-piece implant dislocated into the vitreous.

Retrospective review of a population-based cohort.
Patients undergoing pseudophakic intraocular lens exchange in Olmsted County, Minnesota, between January 1, 1986 and December 31, 2016 were identified from the Rochester Epidemiology Project medical record linkage system. Indications and outcomes were determined, and the incidence rate was calculated as cases per 1 000 000 person-years. Poisson regression analysis was used to assess changes in incidence over time, and the cumulative probability of needing a lens exchange was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis.
Eighty cases of intraocular lens exchange were identified, yielding an overall age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate of 28.4 per million (confidence interval [CI], 22.1-34.7), which increased over the study period (P = .04). The 30-year cumulative probability of intraocular lens exchange among patients undergoing cataract surgery was 1.5% (CI, 0.6%-2.4%), increasing at a relatively constant rate. Dislocated lenses accounted for 72.5% of lens exchanges. Unplanned refractive outcome of primary cataract surgery and uveitis-glaucoma-hyphema syndrome from squared-edged haptics emerged as newer indications for intraocular lens exchange.
The population-based incidence of pseudophakic intraocular lens exchange has increased over the last 30 years, and can be explained by the increase in incidence rate of cataract surgery over the same period.

Patients were identified using an electronic database and paper casefile notes were analysed for all patients. Patients were excluded if they had <3 months follow-up.ResultsTwo hundred and seventy-one patients were included in the analysis. Mean follow-up was 27 months. One hundred and forty-eight patients were vitrectomised before ACIOL placement. One hundred and twenty-three patients underwent vitrectomy at the time of ACIOL placement. Mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) before ACIOL placement was 1.27 LogMar (SD 0.95). Mean BCVA at final follow-up was 0.51 LogMar (SD 0.66) (paired-sample T-test P<0.001). Forty (15%) patients developed postoperative cystoid macular oedema (CMO). Eighty-seven (32%) patients had an intraocular pressure (IOP) rise acutely post ACIOL insertion. Fifteen (6%) patients developed corneal decompensation. Five subsequently required corneal grafting. Sixteen patients had ACIOL displacement or instability requiring further surgery.ConclusionsACIOL insertion after vitrectomy is effective. Ninety-two per cent of patients maintained or gained VA, comparable to previous studies of ACIOL insertion post complicated cataract surgery.

432;29193320;Contrast-balanced binocular treatment in children with deprivation amblyopia.;['binocular treatment', 'deprivation amblyopia', 'paediatric cataracts'];Clinical & experimental optometry;"Children with deprivation amblyopia due to childhood cataract have been excluded from much of the emerging research into amblyopia treatment. An investigation was conducted to determine whether contrast-balanced binocular treatment - a strategy currently being explored for children with anisometropic and strabismic amblyopia - may be effective in children with deprivation amblyopia.
An unmasked, case-series design intended to assess proof of principle was employed. Eighteen children with deprivation amblyopia due to childhood cataracts (early bilateral n = 7, early unilateral n = 7, developmental n = 4), as well as 10 children with anisometropic (n = 8) or mixed anisometropic and strabismic amblyopia (n = 2) were prescribed one hour a day of treatment over a six-week period. Supervised treatment was available. Visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, global motion perception and interocular suppression were measured pre- and post-treatment.
Visual acuity improvements occurred in the anisometropic/strabismic group (0.15 ± 0.05 logMAR, p = 0.014), but contrast sensitivity did not change. As a group, children with deprivation amblyopia had a smaller but statistically significant improvement in weaker eye visual acuity (0.09 ± 0.03 logMAR, p = 0.004), as well a significant improvement in weaker eye contrast sensitivity (p = 0.004). Subgroup analysis suggested that the children with early bilateral deprivation had the largest improvements, while children with early unilateral cataract did not improve. Interestingly, binocular contrast sensitivity also improved in children with early bilateral deprivation. Global motion perception improved for both subgroups with early visual deprivation, as well as children with anisometropic or mixed anisometropic/strabismic amblyopia. Interocular suppression improved for all subgroups except children with early unilateral deprivation.
These data suggest that supervised contrast-balanced binocular treatment should be further investigated as a treatment option for children with deprivation amblyopia. However, for children with more severe deprivation amblyopia due to early unilateral cataracts, supplementary or alternative options should also be explored.";These data suggest that supervised contrast-balanced binocular treatment should be further investigated as a treatment option for children with deprivation amblyopia.

This analysis comprised 823 eyes of 823 patients at Kiev Clinical Ophthalmology Hospital Eye Microsurgery Center, Kiev, Ukraine, operated on by 1 surgeon with 3 different types of hydrophobic lenses: IQ SN60WF (494 eyes) and ReSTOR SN6AD1 (169 eyes) (Alcon Labs, Fort Worth, Texas, USA) and AMO Tecnis MF ZMB00 (160 eyes) (J&J Vision, Santa Ana, California, USA). The full data set was divided into 2 subsets, the first to develop the new formula and the second to evaluate their performance with other most commonly used modern methods of IOL power calculation (Haigis, Hoffer Q, Holladay 1, Holladay 2, SRK/T, and T2). The VRF algorithm is empirical; it uses 4 predictors for estimation of postoperative lens position, including axial length, corneal power (K), preoperative anterior chamber depth (corneal epithelium to lens), and horizontal corneal diameter. The results are also stratified into groups of short (≤22 mm), medium (>22 to <24.5 mm), medium-long (≥24.5 to <26 mm), and long (≥26 mm) axial length.
The mean error, median absolute error, and mean absolute error were evaluated for all 7 methods with 1 IOL type.

All patients had a bilateral presentation with 22 eyes having lenticular myopia with a mean refractive error of -11.5±12.945 DS. Ten eyes presented with glaucoma of which six had raised intraocular pressure (IOP) >21 mm Hg. A total of 23 eyes underwent lens extraction for dislocation/subluxation. Lens extraction helped lower overall IOP. Refractive rehabilitation was done with ACIOL, posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL) with capsular tension ring, and scleral-fixated intraocular lens (SFIOL) in respective cases with ACIOLs being the most commonly used option.ConclusionsSpherophakia is a rare condition, which exhibits a varying degree of lenticular myopia, glaucoma, and subluxation of the crystalline lens. Lensectomy with proper rehabilitation using ACIOL, PCIOL, or SFIOL is a method of managing subluxation and unacceptable myopia.

Review of historical literature and author experiences pertaining to cataract surgery, with commentary and perspective.
By this time, cataract surgery has advanced to the point that Kelman's introduction of phacoemulsification and use of intraocular lenses (IOLs), both very controversial when initially introduced, have become state of the art. Outpatient surgery, minimally limited mobility, sutureless incisions, and topical anesthesia also have become key components of standard treatment. The author envisions availability of medications for nuclear sclerosis and presbyopia, expansion of lens surgery for refractive purposes with postsurgical adjustment and unprecedented precision, increased mechanization of lens removal with emphasis on uncomplicated surgery rather than refractive precision, and accommodating IOLs all becoming standard.

450;28799565;Modified technique of endocapsular lens aspiration for severely subluxated lenses.;[];Eye (London, England);PurposeSeverely subluxated crystalline lenses pose a difficult situation to anterior segment surgeons and can only be managed surgically by removal of the lens as well as the capsular bag. Several techniques have been described in literature for the management of such cases. We describe a modified technique of endocapsular lens aspiration by the limbal route for lens extraction through small incisions on the cornea.Patients and methodsThirty-two eyes of 16 consecutive patients with severely subluxated crystalline lenses were recruited in the study. All eyes underwent a modified technique of lens aspiration within the capsular bag using a single instrument, vitrectomy cutter, and irrigation cannula, followed by sacrificing of the capsular bag. The patients were either left aphakic or implanted with an open loop anterior chamber intraocular lens (ACIOL Kelman Multiflex) and prospectively followed up for a period of 3 months.ResultsThe mean age of the patients was 9 years 3 months±3 years (range 5-15 yrs). All eyes underwent complete lens aspiration within the capsular bag with no dislocation of the lens matter. ACIOL was inserted in 22 eyes (68.7%) and 10 eyes (31.2%) were left aphakic. All the surgeries were uneventful. The mean best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 3 months post surgery was 0.47±0.11 logMAR which was significantly better than pre-operative BCVA (P=0.001). The percentage endothelial cell loss at 3 months was 7.1%. There was no evidence of glaucoma, corneal decompensation, or retinal detachment. The astigmatism which increased from 1.45D±086 preoperatively to 3.76D±2.02 1 week post-operatively due to sutures reduced to 1.97D±0.81 post suture removal at 3 months.ConclusionThe modified technique of endocapsular lens aspiration proves to be a simple and effective method of removal of the lens-capsular bag complex in severely subluxated lenses.;;;;;10.1038/eye.2017.160;2017-08-12;[{'lastname': 'Khokhar', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Cataract and Refractive Surgery Services, Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Aron', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Cataract and Refractive Surgery Services, Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Yadav', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Cataract and Refractive Surgery Services, Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Pillay', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Cataract and Refractive Surgery Services, Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Agarwal', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Ophthalmology, Cataract and Refractive Surgery Services, Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.'}]

Other IOLs (29 eyes) were toric (SN6AT3-6), spherical (SN60AT), three-piece (MN60MA) and multifocal (ReSTOR SN6AD1, PanOptix TFNT00 and Finevision Micro F trifocal).
The study population was comprised of 95 patients with a mean age of 72 ± 10 years. Unsolicited complaints of negative dysphotopsia were reported by eight patients (8%), and two of them had a resolution of symptoms within 1 month of follow-up. Eighteen patients (19%) reported negative dysphotopsia at the time of the interview. Two patients reported bothersome negative dysphotopsia, and one of them was successfully treated with implantation of a supplementary IOL in the ciliary sulcus. Patients with negative dysphotopsia were younger than patients without dysphotopsia (p = 0.045) and had shorter axial eye length (p = 0.04), a tendency for higher IOL power (p = 0.09) and a higher CDVA (p = 0.001).
The incidence of unsolicited negative dysphotopsia after sequential cataract surgery appears to be a substantial underestimation of complaints identified in active interviewing. Although symptoms are not bothersome in the majority of cases, some patients with undiagnosed severe negative dysphotopsia may benefit from reassurance or secondary treatment.";The incidence of unsolicited negative dysphotopsia after sequential cataract surgery appears to be a substantial underestimation of complaints identified in active interviewing.

Retrospective analysis of 108 eyes (70 patients) underwent uneventful phacoemulsification surgery with implant of Alcon-SN60WF intraocular lens (IOL). Forty-five eyes were intentionally targeted to myopia (-0.75 to -1.25 dpt), while the others targeted between 0 and -0.75 dpt. Preoperative axial length and keratometry (K) were measured with optical biometry (LENSTAR-Haag-Streit). Postoperative spherical equivalent was assessed 3 ± 2 months after surgery.
There is a significant correlation between the mean keratometry (K) and the Haigis-SRKT prediction differences (P < 0.001; r = 0.749). Linear regression indicates that a decrease of 1 diopter (D) on K implies an increase of 0.23 D on the difference between formulae prediction. K alone does not influence the prediction error for both formulas. The difference between the two formulae is dependent on K (r = -0.75; P < 0.01). Moreover, eyes with K <43.75 targeted at myopia (n = 23) showed a significant myopic shift of -0.26 ± 0.09 dpt (P < 0.05) with Haigis, but a hyperopic shift of 0.24 ± 0.09 dpt (P < 0.05) with SRKT.
Divergences between Haigis and SRKT formulae cause uncertainty in choosing the IOL. Our results indicate that, in eyes with lower preoperative K, an IOL targeted at myopia might result in a small, but significant myopic shift with the Haigis formula, while a hyperopic shift with the SRKT formula.";Divergences between Haigis and SRKT formulae cause uncertainty in choosing the IOL.

461;28509425;Methods of fixation of intraocular lenses according to the anatomical structures in trauma eyes.;['dislocation of the lens', 'lens fixation', 'lens trauma', 'ocular trauma'];Clinical anatomy (New York, N.Y.);Ocular trauma can lead to severe visual impairment and morbidity, depending on the anatomical structures affected. The main causes of ocular trauma include foreign bodies, impact by an object, falls, and chemicals. Most ocular traumas occur in children or young male adults. A meticulous slit lamp examination is crucial for assessing all anatomical structures. Trauma to the crystalline lens can result in dislocation, an intralenticular foreign body, cataract, fragmentation, and capsular breach. An intraocular lens (IOL) can endure subluxation or luxation under the conjunctiva, into the anterior chamber or the vitreous, or can be extruded. The surgical approach depends on the condition and morphology of the lens and the anatomical structures surrounding it. If there is capsular bag support, a secondary IOL can be placed in the sulcus using remnants of the damaged capsule. If there is no capsular bag support, a secondary IOL can be fixated to the anterior chamber angle, to the iris, or to the sclera. A detailed history of injury cannot always be obtained in trauma settings. Proper education, supervision, and certified safety eye protectors could prevent up to 90% of ocular injuries. Lens trauma can be treated with various surgical procedures and fixation techniques, which nevertheless require advanced surgical skills owing to the fine anatomical structure of the anterior segment. A careful surgical strategy should be established for a globe reconstruction after trauma with secondary lens implantation. Clin.
